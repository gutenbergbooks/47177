<p class="center xxlarge p2">THE SUNBONNET BABIES<br />IN ITALY</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE ARRIVAL AT NAPLES</h2>

<p class="p2">"See that smoking mountain, Molly! Look!
I believe it is a volcano. It is Mount Vesuvius.
Yes, I know it is Mount Vesuvius!"
</p><p>
May, the Sunbonnet Baby, was talking with
Molly, her little Sunbonnet Baby sister. They
were standing on the deck of a great ocean
steamer. They had been sailing on the steamer
for days and days. They had sailed more than
four thousand miles away from their home in
America. Now they were almost at the end of
their journey. They would very soon be in
Italy.
</p><p>
The big steamer was moving slowly up the
beautiful Bay of Naples, straight toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
busy, noisy city of Naples. Rising from the
shore, not far away, was the smoking mountain
of Vesuvius, about which the Sunbonnet Babies'
father had told them such strange stories.
</p><p>
He told them that Mount Vesuvius was like
a great kettle full of boiling rock, that sometimes
the fire under the kettle becomes so hot it
boils over, covering the mountain sides and even
the plains with melted rock and hot ashes.
Such mountains, he said, are called volcanoes.
</p><p>
Molly and May stood on the deck of the
steamer eagerly watching the smoking volcano,
wondering if it would ever boil over again.
</p><p>
"I almost wish it would boil over now!"
cried Molly. "Wouldn't it be wonderful to see
red-hot rock come right out of the top of the
mountain and fall down all around it!"
</p><p>
"Yes, it would be wonderful," said May,
"but I am sure I don't want to see it. The
hot ashes might even reach us here on the
steamer."
</p><p>
"Father says he will take us to see the
old city of Pompeii, which was buried by
Vesuvius nearly two thousand years ago. Men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
are digging away the ashes and cinders now, so
we can see just how the people used to live."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i013.jpg" width="500" alt="two babies on boat, one pointing to shore" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Pompeii must be right over there," said May</i></span></div>

<p>"Pompeii must be right over there near the
foot of the mountain," said May. "Isn't it
strange to think that those trees and farms may
be growing on top of an old, old city?"
</p><p>
"Look at the big city just ahead of our
boat!" cried Molly. "It is Naples. We are
almost there!"
</p><p>
"Why, the city is the shape of a big,
new moon," said May. "It curves right around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>

the shore of this lovely, blue bay, and climbs
up the hillside to meet the blue sky. Our boat
is sailing straight in between the long points."
</p><p>
"O May! Do you suppose it is snowing
at home to-day? It seems like summer here,
but it is really the middle of March. The trees
and the grass are all green. And there is a boat
full of oranges and lemons just being unloaded."
</p><p>
"See that basketful of beautiful roses! I
hope we can go ashore quickly. I want to buy
a lovely red rose for mother to wear."
</p><p>
Not many minutes later the happy travelers
were hurrying from the big steamer. There
were other travelers going ashore, too, and a
crowd of noisy, jolly people seemed to be
waiting for them. Most of the women and
little girls were bareheaded and wore gay-colored
dresses and aprons. They were very
much interested in the strange travelers,
especially in the two little Sunbonnet Babies.
</p><p>
A smiling, brown-eyed Italian girl ran along
beside them, peeping at the two happy faces
hidden under the big sunbonnets, and talking
very fast in a soft, sweet voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" width="500" alt="girl smiling at sunbonnet babies" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They knew she liked them because she smiled so sweetly</i></span></div>

<p>The Sunbonnet Babies could not understand
one word she said, but they knew she liked
them because she smiled so sweetly.
</p><p>
If it had not been for this kind little girl,
Molly and May might easily have been frightened.
A great many men and boys were standing
close about them shouting and swinging their
arms, trying to get passengers for their carriages.
Even the Sunbonnet Babies' father did not
quite know what to do, so many men wanted
to carry his bags for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i016.jpg" width="500" alt="girl taking Molly and May by the hand by carriage" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>She took Molly and May each by the hand</i></span></div>

<p>The little girl, seeing his trouble, looked up
with a smile and asked him to follow her.
She then took Molly and May each by the
hand and led them through the crowd to a
long line of carriages. In a moment a smiling,
brown-eyed man was beside them, bowing and
offering to drive them to their hotel.
</p><p>
The little girl called the man <i>il padre</i>,
which means "father," and he spoke to her as
<i>Tessa mia</i>, which means "my Tessa." Indeed,
the little girl looked so much like the brown-eyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
man, it was easy to guess that she was
his own little daughter. They had the same
bright smile, the same soft voice, and the same
kind manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i017.jpg" width="500" alt="family in carriage, Molly and May tipping the girl" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They each took a big brown penny out of their bags</i></span></div>

<p>The travelers gladly stepped into the man's
low carriage and told him where to drive them,
saying a pleasant <i>grazie</i> to the little girl whom
they were leaving behind. Yes, they did something
more than just say "thank you." They
each took a big brown penny from their bags
and dropped the pennies into Tessa's hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
</p><p>
Then they all three said <i>grazie</i> again, and
laughed and waved their good-bys. The driver
cracked his long whip, and the horses dashed
away up the busy street.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i018.jpg" width="200" alt="driver holding out hand" /></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i020.jpg" width="500" alt="family in carriage in city" /></div>

<h2 class="p2">THE FIRST DRIVE</h2>

<p class="p2">The Sunbonnet Babies were now really
frightened. The streets were crowded, and the
drivers all seemed to be trying to get ahead of
the carriages in front of them. They cracked
their whips, they shouted to one another in loud
voices, and they drove their horses as fast as
they could make them go.
</p><p>
The noise and the strange faces and the
stranger language might have frightened even
the Overall Boys just a little, if they had been
with Molly and May.
</p><p>
But no one needed to be frightened. The
men in Naples are fine drivers, though they do
like to make a great show about it. And the
nervous little horses enjoy dashing through the
streets to the sound of cracking whips.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
</p><p>
Everybody was jolly and happy, so the
Sunbonnet Babies soon forgot their fears and
began to enjoy their first drive in Italy. The
carriage passed along a busy street where there
were many small shops and handsome stores.
</p><p>
After a few minutes Molly said, in a somewhat
disappointed voice, "Why, this street looks
like the streets in our city at home. I thought
it would look different in Italy."
</p><p>
"Look up that side street," said her father.
"Did you ever see a street like that in America?"
</p><p>
"That is not a street, father," said Molly.
"That is a long flight of stairs. But why do
they build stairs out of doors?"
</p><p>
"Yes, that is a street, and a very popular
one, too," said her father. "Naples is built on
the side of a hill, you know, and many of the
streets that go up the hill are flights of steps like
this one."
</p><p>
"O father, may we get out and walk a little
way up the street?" asked Molly. "I want
to see what all those people are doing."
</p><p>
"And I want to take some pictures with my
camera," said May.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i022.jpg" width="500" alt="babies watching two barefoot boys eat spaghetti while walking down stairs" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They lifted the long, white strips of macaroni high above their heads</i></span></div>

<p>So they quickly got out of the carriage and
began climbing the long flight of steps. It was
about noon, and some of the people seemed to be
eating their midday meal.
</p><p>
One poor old man was sitting on a step
eating some hard bread and olives. Near him
were two barefooted boys who had just bought a
plate heaping full of macaroni. A man stood in
an open doorway cooking the macaroni over a
queer little stove and selling it to the people.
</p><p>
The boys had no knives or forks to use, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
fingers were much better. They lifted the long
white strips of macaroni high above their heads,
then they opened their mouths very wide, and
down it slipped. They didn't bite it, they didn't
chew it, they just sucked the long pieces down
their throats as fast as they could. They seemed
to be racing with each other to see who could
swallow the most in the shortest time.
</p><p>
Molly and May watched the boys anxiously
until the macaroni was all gone. Then how they
laughed and clapped their hands! They thought
it was the strangest dinner and the strangest
game they had ever seen.
</p><div class='figcenter'><img class="figright" src="images/i023.jpg" width="150" alt="brushes and fans" /></div><p>
The boys thought it was a fine dinner. They
were business boys. That morning they had
sold more brushes and fans than
usual, so they were celebrating
by having some delicious macaroni
for dinner.</p>

<p>These boys made their own brushes and
fans, and went about the streets selling them.
Of course Molly and May each bought one of
the fans, for they wanted the boys to have
another good dinner the next day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
</p><p>
As the little party walked on up the steps
they saw many things that were strange and
interesting. Little children were leaning out of
the high windows, talking and laughing with
other children in the houses across the way.
</p><p>
Women were hanging out their washing on
ropes stretched from one window to another, and
talked loudly with people who were on the steps
below.
</p><p>
One woman stood on a narrow iron balcony
in front of her window and lowered a basket by a
long rope. When the basket reached the steps,
a small boy ran to it and took out a covered
bowl in which he found two big copper pennies.
</p><p>
The boy carried the pennies to a man near by,
who was making hot snail soup over a small
stove. The man filled the bowl with some of
his delicious soup, and the boy put it carefully
back into the basket. Then the woman drew it
slowly up, up to her high balcony.
</p><p>
The small boy reached the balcony almost as
quickly as the basket did, for he knew that some
of that hot soup was for him, and he liked snail
soup almost better than macaroni.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i025.jpg" width="500" alt="woman pulling up basket over balcony railing" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>One woman stood on an iron balcony, lowered a basket by a long rope</i></span></div>

<p>As Molly and May watched the preparations
for dinner on the little balcony, May suddenly
cried, "Look! Look! They have a big dog up
there!"
</p><p>
"No, that is not a dog, it is a goat," said her
father. "I suppose it lives up there with the
family and gives them milk every day. That
family must have more money than most of the
people who live on this street. They eat snail
soup for dinner, they have a balcony in front
of their window, and they keep a goat."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
</p><p>
"Perhaps the little boy's father owns one of
these small shops and makes lots of money
selling macaroni, or soup, or onions, or bread, or
flowers, or roasted chestnuts," said May.
</p><p>
"Well, shall we buy our dinner here, or shall
we go to the hotel for it?" asked their father.
"Wouldn't you like some snail soup, or macaroni,
or onions for dinner?"
</p><p>
"Oh, no, no!" cried both Molly and May.
"We are hungry, but we don't want snail soup
or onions."
</p><p>
So they hurried back to their carriage and
were soon driving rapidly up the hill to a fine
hotel, where they were to stay for several days.
</p>

<h2 class="p2">SEEING STRANGE SIGHTS</h2>

<p class="p2">Next morning, as soon as breakfast was over,
the Sunbonnet Babies were out upon the sidewalk
watching some small boys spin their tops.
</p><p>
One of the boys had a top which looked
like a tiny doll with a very full skirt. The
boy gave the top a strong twist with his hands,
and away it went dancing across the sidewalk
and back again, just as if it were alive.
</p><p>
When the boy saw that his dancing doll
pleased the Sunbonnet Babies, he sprang up
and made a very low bow and held out his
cap for a penny, saying, "Un soldo, signorine!"
</p><p>
The Sunbonnet Babies' father had put a
number of big Italian pennies into their bags,
and had said they might spend them just as
they wished, so of course each of the happy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
barefooted boys received a penny, for which
they said <i>grazie</i> a great many times.
</p><p>
Molly and May had already learned that
<i>grazie</i> in Italian means "thank you" in English,
and that <i>un soldo</i> means "one penny."
</p>
<div class='figright'><img class="figright" src="images/i029.jpg" width="200" alt="donkey" />
</div>
<p>While they were giving their pennies to the
boys, and while everybody was laughing and
saying <i>grazie</i>, something very interesting was
coming up the street.
</p><p>
The sharp tinkle of a bell made Molly look
up quickly and cry, "O May! Look at those
little goats! A man is driving them up the
street. He is stopping at the door of that house.
What do you suppose he is going to do?"
</p><p>
"I know!" cried
May. "He is going
to milk the goats.
Look! A woman
has come out of the
house with a tin
cup in her hand."
</p><p>
"Yes, and now
the man is milking
right into her cup."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i030.jpg" width="500" alt="babies looking at man holding cup and his goat" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Oh, what a queer milk cart!" laughed Molly</i></span></div>

<p>"And there are two other women who want
their cups filled."
</p><p>
"Oh, what a queer milk cart!" laughed
Molly. "People surely get fresh milk when
it comes from a live milk cart like that."
</p><p>
"See what the man is doing now!" exclaimed
May. "He is driving one of the goats right into
the house. I believe he is going to take it up
stairs. Probably some one lives up there who
cannot bring her cup down to the street, so he
drives a goat up to her door and milks it there."

</p><p>
"I wonder if goat's milk is as good as cow's
milk. I should like to try it some time," said May.
</p><p>
Just then the Sunbonnet Babies heard a
pleasant voice saying, "Buon giorno!" and they
looked around to see their driver of the day
before smiling at them from his carriage.
</p><p>
"Oh, good morning!" they said. "We will
go and tell father that you are here. Perhaps
he will want you to take us for a drive."
</p><p>
Sure enough, in a few minutes they were
all seated in the low carriage ready for a long
drive into the country. The driver, whose name
was Pietro, sat high up in front, close behind
his two small horses.
</p><p>
When everyone was ready, Pietro cracked
his long whip in the air, the horses jingled the
bells on their high collars, and away they went
through the narrow, crooked streets.
</p><p>
It did not take them long to reach the
country road which followed the shore of the
lovely blue bay. Here and there beside the road
grew tall pine trees whose tops looked like great,
green umbrellas raised against the deep blue sky.
On the hillside above the road were small groves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of lemon and orange trees bearing heavy loads
of green and yellow fruit.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i032.jpg" width="500" alt="two women carrying baskets on side of road" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The carriage passed a number of country people carrying baskets</i></span></div>

<p>The carriage passed a number of country
people walking toward the city carrying baskets
full of things to sell&mdash;jewelry and flowers and
fruit. Two small boys carried strings of onions
over their shoulders. They hurried happily
along, as if they expected to make their fortune
selling those onions. They called a merry
"Buon giorno" to the little American girls as
the carriage rolled past them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i033.jpg" width="500" alt="family in carriage seeing two boys carrying onions" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Two small boys carried strings of onions over their shoulders</i></span></div>

<p>Soon the road led through a village where
the people seemed very poor indeed. The little
children were ragged and dirty and hungry, and
there were, oh, so many of them! Most of the
children were too small to earn money, but they
were not too small to beg for it.
</p><p>
"Oh, I never, never saw such poor little
children!" cried May. "Where do you suppose
they all come from? See, they are running after
our carriage and begging for <i>un soldo</i>. Let's give
them some pennies, Molly."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i034.jpg" width="500" alt="throwing coins to the children" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Molly and May opened their bags and began throwing pennies</i></span></div>

<p>So Molly and May opened their bags and
began throwing pennies into the crowd of eager
little children, who kept up with the carriage
even though the horses were trotting fast.
</p><p>
It was great fun for everybody. The children
caught the flying pennies in their mouths, in their
caps, and in their hands, scrambling for them
on the dusty road. But soon the horses trotted
too fast for them, and they were left far behind.
Molly and May could see them dividing the
pennies so each child should have at least one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
</p><p>
After a while Pietro looked down from his
high seat and said that he would like to take
them to a very wonderful place if they would
not ask him any questions about it until they
got there.
</p><p>
Pietro had been so kind they trusted him and
told him he might drive them anywhere he
wished. He then turned his horses away from
the blue bay and up a low hill, where almost no
trees or green things were growing. At the top of
the hill Pietro said they must leave the carriage
and each pay a <i>lira</i> to the gatekeeper there,
and they would see something interesting.
</p><p>
They wondered if there really could be
anything interesting on such a barren-looking
hill, but they did as Pietro told them. Then
a man, with a burning torch in his hand, led the
way through a gate.
</p><p>
"Now," he said in quite broken English,
"I will show you something wonderful!"
</p><p>
"This is not a bit wonderful," said Molly.
"It looks like a big football field with a high
wall of earth all around it. There isn't even a
flower or a bit of green grass anywhere."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
</p><p>
"Follow me," said their guide, "and you
shall see the wonderful thing. Perhaps you will
be frightened, but I will take care of you."
</p><p>
So they followed the guide across the bare,
round field. But they had not gone far when
Molly said anxiously, "How strange the ground
sounds as we walk on it! It sounds hollow."
</p><p>
"Yes, and how hot it is!" said May. "I
can feel it right through my shoes. It almost
burns my feet."
</p><p>
"Why, it burns mine, too, May!"
</p><p>
"Do you hear that queer, bubbling noise,
Molly? Listen! It sounds like a pudding baking
in mother's oven. What do you suppose it is?"
</p><p>
"I will show you," said the guide. "A <i>very
big</i> pudding is being baked in a <i>very big</i> oven.
You are walking on the top crust of that
pudding. Would you like to take a look underneath
it? Here is a man who will scrape off
some of the crust and let us see what is going on."
</p><p>
And so, with a hoe, the man scraped away two
or three inches of loose gravel, and there they
saw hot sand boiling and bubbling just like
a hot pudding. A cloud of black smoke rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
from the boiling sand, and a very bad odor
made Molly and May cover their noses with
their handkerchiefs. May tried to pick up a
small stone near her feet to carry home with her,
but it was so hot she dropped it very quickly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i037.jpg" width="500" alt="babies holding handkerchiefs over faces while man rakes top of volcano open" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Oh! oh!" cried May. "Is the world going to burn up?"</i></span></div>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Where are we? Is this
a volcano?" cried Molly.
</p><p>
"That's just what it is," said their guide.
"This is the volcano of Solfatara, and we are
on the top of it. This big round field, or basin,
is the crater of the volcano. It boiled over many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
years ago, then it cooled off. Now it is getting
hotter again, but it is not nearly so hot as
Vesuvius over yonder."
</p><p>
"Oh, it's hot enough!" exclaimed May. "I
don't like volcanoes. I'm not having a nice time.
I want to go back to the carriage. What if the
volcano should boil over while we are on it?"
</p><p>
"It will not," said the guide. "It is not hot
enough yet. But something may happen some
time. I hope I shall not be here when it does.
Now let us take a look into those cracks where
the smoke and gas are pouring out. I will
swing my torch over one of the cracks and you
shall see something wonderful. Now watch!"
</p><p>
In a moment hot flames shot several feet into
the air, and clouds of black smoke surrounded
the little party.
</p><p>
"Oh! oh!" cried May. "Is the world going
to burn up?"
</p><p>
"No, indeed!" said her father. "Don't be
frightened. That was only a little gas which
the guide set on fire with his torch, just as
mother lights her gas stove at home. There is
a pretty big furnace underneath us, and it sends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
off a good deal of gas. It is the gas that smells
so bad and makes us cover our noses."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i039.jpg" width="500" alt="man holding stick on fire for babies to see" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>A cloud of black smoke rose from the boiling sand</i></span></div>

<p>"I don't like it," said Molly. "Please can't
we go somewhere else? I don't like volcanoes."
</p><p>
"I don't like them either," said her mother.
"We have seen enough of this one, I am sure."
</p><p>
So they went back quickly to the carriage
and were soon on their way to Naples.
</p><p>
"Just think how hot the earth must be inside,
if it can boil so near the surface!" exclaimed
Molly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
</p><p>
"You know, ages and ages ago, our world
was part of the red-hot sun," said their father.
"When it broke away from the sun it began to
whirl around very fast. Little by little it has
grown cooler, until now there are only a few
places on the surface that are still hot. These
places are called volcanoes. Once in a while
the hot mass inside bursts through and burns
everything it touches."
</p><p>
"I am glad I have seen Solfatara," said May,
"but I think I don't care to go so near another
volcano&mdash;no, not even Vesuvius."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i042.jpg" width="500" alt="babies looking at frieze" /></div>

<h2 class="p2">A VISIT TO THE MUSEUM</h2>

<p class="p2">Every morning, as long as the Sunbonnet
Babies stayed in Naples, Pietro drove up to
their hotel to see if he could be of service to
them. Once he brought his little daughter,
Tessa, for Molly and May wanted very much
to see their first little Italian friend again.
</p><p>
That morning Pietro drove them across the
city to visit the great museum. Tessa had been
to the museum many times, and knew which
rooms would interest the Sunbonnet Babies most.
</p><p>
"Follow me," she said. "I will show you
the oldest and loveliest things you ever saw."
</p><p>
Fortunately the Sunbonnet Babies' father and
mother understood Tessa's language, so they
could tell Molly and May in English all that
Tessa said in Italian. Before long the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
little girls began to understand a little of the
strange language themselves.
</p><p>
They spent nearly the whole forenoon in
the museum looking at strange, old things that
had once been in the homes of Pompeii.
</p><p>
The city of Pompeii was buried under many
feet of ashes thrown out by the volcano in the
year seventy-nine. It remained buried more than
seventeen hundred years. In fact, the world had
forgotten all about the old city, when one day
an Italian workman discovered a very old house
right underneath his farm. Some say he was
digging a well when he discovered it.
</p><p>
Other men helped dig away the earth and
ashes, and now, after more than a hundred
years, a large part of the old city is uncovered.
</p><p>
The strangest thing about it is that the ashes
and cinders which buried the city did very little
injury to the houses, except to crush in the roofs.
</p><p>
Many of the beautiful paintings on the walls
of the houses, as well as lovely marble vases
and fountains, are almost as perfect now as when
they were buried so many, many years ago.
But the sun and the rain and the air might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
spoil them if they were left in the uncovered
houses, now that the ashes have been taken out.
So the best things have been carried up to the
city of Naples and put in the museum there
for safe-keeping.
</p><p>
It was some of these interesting old things
Tessa wanted the Sunbonnet Babies to see.
They wandered together through room after
room of the great museum, looking at vases and
dishes of all shapes and kinds. There were
queer old bronze pots and pans and kettles,
and lovely bottles and pitchers made of beautiful
blue-green glass. There was an iron fireplace,
and there were queer bronze lamps and money
chests and rings and bracelets and combs and
needles and thimbles and fishhooks. But the
children were most interested in some slates
and slate pencils and inkstands and pens and
musical instruments which they found there.
</p><p>
"It looks as if the boys and girls who lived
two thousand years ago had to study and
practice just as we do now," said Molly.
</p><p>
"Yes, and the women baked bread, too,"
said Tessa. "Here are some round loaves that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
a poor woman was taking out of her oven when
the ashes from the volcano covered her."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i045.jpg" width="500" alt="girl showing babies slates and pencils" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The children were interested in some slates and slate pencils</i></span></div>

<p>"And here are jars of apricots and olives
which were put up nearly two thousand years
ago. I wonder how they would taste now."
</p><p>
"I am glad I don't have to eat them," said
Molly. "But when are we going to Pompeii to
see where all these things were found, father?"
</p><p>
"We will go to-morrow, if you like," said
her father. "But I am hungry now, and Pietro
is waiting outside to take us back to the hotel."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
</p><p>
"We are all hungry, and I guess we are all
tired, too. I know I am," said May.
</p><p>
As the little party drove back through the
busy streets they were not too tired to enjoy
the sights around them.
</p><p>
"I believe half the people of Naples live
out of doors," said Molly. "See, there is a
shoemaker working at his bench right on the
sidewalk. And look at that tailor, sitting by
his shop door, sewing as fast as he can sew."
</p><div class='figcenter'><img class="figleft" src="images/i046.jpg" width="150" alt="man writing letter for woman standing in front of him" />
</div><p>"Do you know what that man on the corner
is doing?" asked Pietro.
</p><p>
"He is writing," said May.
</p><p>
"Yes," said Pietro. "He writes letters for
people who cannot write
for themselves. He is
writing a letter now for
the woman who stands
beside him. She tells him
what she wants to say
and he writes it down for
her. A great many of our
people cannot read or write, so the public
letter writers do a very good business."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i047.jpg" width="500" alt="the three girls accepting flowers" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Oh! oh! oh! May we have them?" they cried all together</i></span></div>

<p>"I should rather sell flowers than write
letters," said Tessa.
</p><p>
"So should I!" exclaimed May. "Look at
the beautiful roses that man has to sell. He
wants us to buy some. Please stop, Pietro!"
</p><p>
But before Pietro could stop his horses, the
man had sprung up onto the low step of the
carriage and was holding a big bunch of beautiful
roses right in front of the three happy children.
</p><p>
"Oh! oh! oh! May we have them? How
much are they?" they cried all together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
</p><p>
"Una lira, signorine, una lira," said the man,
smiling and lifting his cap.
</p><p>
"O father!" cried May. "He will sell us a
big bouquet of beautiful roses for one lira. That
is only a few cents, isn't it? Please buy some
for us."
</p><p>
In a moment one bunch of the lovely roses
was in Molly's hands and another bunch was
in May's hands and another in Tessa's hands,
while the happy flower man hurried back to
his stand with three whole lire in his pocket.
</p><p>
A little later Pietro and Tessa were driving
alone toward their home on a crowded side
street. Tessa still held the lovely roses, and
tied up in her handkerchief was the money the
Sunbonnet Babies' father had paid Pietro and
his little daughter for taking care of them all
the forenoon. It seemed a real fortune to Tessa.
She had a wonderful time planning how she
would like to spend it, and thinking about her
generous little American friends.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i050.jpg" width="500" alt="Girls and mother walking on path in part" /></div>

<h2 class="p2">AN AFTERNOON IN THE PARK</h2>

<p class="p2">That afternoon the Sunbonnet Babies begged
to visit the lovely park near the shore of the
bay. They wanted to run and play games with
other children under the tall green trees.
</p><p>
"How would you like to take a look under
the deep water and see all the strange creatures
that live there?" asked their father.
</p><p>
"Oh, that would be wonderful! But how
can we do it?" asked Molly.
</p><p>
"We can do it easily when we get to the
park," said her father.
</p><p>
"Let's do it the very first thing. Just think
of seeing how all the big and little fish live
'way down in the deep, deep ocean!"
</p><p>
"I am afraid we shall be drowned," said
May. "I think I shall not like to go under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the deep water any better than I liked to walk
on top of the volcano."
</p><p>
"Why, it will be as easy as walking on this
path," said their father. "Here we are at the
door already. Shall we open it and take a look
into the fish world?"
</p><p>
"Oh, dear! I feel as if I were Alice in
Wonderland," said May. "Is this the door into
the long, dark tunnel? I wonder if we shall
fall down, down, down the tunnel just as Alice
did. O father! Will the fish talk with us, the
same as the rabbit and all the other animals
talked with Alice?"
</p><p>
"If you should happen to fall asleep, as
Alice did, the fish will probably tell you all
their secrets," said her father. "But there is no
long, dark tunnel here down which you must
fall. We will each pay this man at the door
two lire, then he will open the door and let us
go in."
</p><p>
In another moment the door closed behind
them, and they stood in the strangest place
they had ever seen. It looked like the bottom
of the great ocean, with ragged rocks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
slippery seaweed everywhere, and many kinds of
strange fish swimming quietly about them.
</p><p>
And yet, the water did not wet the children,
and they could not touch the fish. A strong
glass wall held back both the water and the fish.
</p><p>
Molly and May walked along a narrow path
close beside the glass wall, and watched the queer
fish chase each other about in the water or lie
lazily under the shadow of a big rock.
</p><p>
At last Molly said, "Why, the bottom of the
ocean looks very much like the top of the earth.
There are hills and valleys and rocks and sand
and green things growing everywhere."
</p><p>
"See that tiny forest of pink coral. I suppose
our coral neck chains grew at the bottom
of the ocean in just that way."
</p><p>
"And see those timid little animals peeping
from the doors of their pretty shell houses. I
wonder if they like always to carry about such
heavy houses on their backs."
</p><p>
"Here is a whole family of lazy turtles,"
called May. "Look at that big fellow! I
believe his shell is large enough for me to
creep into, if he were not inside of it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i053.jpg" width="500" alt="father pointing at turtle" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Look at that big fellow!"</i></span></div>

<p>"I advise you not to try it while he is there,"
said her father. "If he once took a bite of you,
he would never let go."
</p><p>
"Oh, my!" exclaimed Molly. "But see
those little starfish and that big soft jellyfish.
They are not afraid of the turtle. And those
eels are playing close about him."
</p><p>
Just then a frightened scream came from
May, who had walked ahead of the others.
</p><p>
"Come quickly!" she cried. "Here is a
big, big round thing with eight long arms, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
legs, I don't know which they are. They keep
reaching out as if they were trying to get hold
of something. And its two big round eyes
are looking straight at me! I'm glad the glass
wall is between us. It's the worst looking
thing I ever saw in all my life! What is it,
father?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i054.jpg" width="500" alt="girls and father looking at octopus" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Its two big round eyes are looking straight at me!"</i></span></div>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed her father. "That
is an octopus. A real, live octopus! It is a
big one, too. It can easily reach six or seven
feet with those long legs."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
</p><p>
"Why is it called an octopus, father?"
asked Molly. "Why haven't we seen one before,
and what does it do with so many legs?"
</p><p>
"It is called an octopus because it has eight
feet, and the word octopus means 'eight-footed.'
We have never seen one before because it lives
at the bottom of the ocean, and we have not
visited the bottom of the ocean until to-day.
I suppose it uses its feet more in catching food
than it does in walking. I have heard that
when it winds them around anything it never
lets go."
</p><p>
Just then their mother called, "Come with
me! I have found the strangest fish you ever
heard of. If you touch the fish, it will give
you a tiny electric shock. Who wants to try
it?"
</p><p>
"Oh, I do!" cried Molly, and in went her
hand to stroke the sleepy fish lazily swimming
about in a small tank of water. But the hand
came out more quickly than it went in.
</p><p>
"Oh! oh!" she cried. "My hand prickles
just as if it were asleep. What a strange,
strange fish! You touch it, May."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
</p><p>
"No!" said May. "I don't want to touch
it. I don't want an electric shock. I want to
go back to the park and play."
</p><p>
"Very well," said her father. "I believe
we have stayed with these deep-sea creatures
long enough. We will go out through the
secret door, the way we came in."
</p><p>
And so, in a few moments, they were all
standing in the bright sunshine looking out
over the deep blue water which was the home
of so many strange and interesting creatures.
</p><p>
"Have we really been 'way down under
that deep water, father?" asked Molly. "Or
was it just a fish museum that we were in?"
</p><p>
"That is a good name for it," said her
father. "We have been in an aquarium. Many
of the fish that are caught alive in the Mediterranean
Sea are brought to this aquarium, so
people may study and enjoy them."
</p><p>
"I feel as if I had really and truly been to
the bottom of the sea," said Molly. "I am
glad I am not a fish. I should much rather be
a little girl and have a ride in that goat cart.
Those Italian children have just had a ride.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
See, they are each paying the man a penny.
O sir! Please may we ride next?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i057.jpg" width="500" alt="girls in goat cart" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>May shook the reins and away they went</i></span></div>

<p>"And please may I drive the goats?" asked
May. "I know how to drive my pony."
</p><p>
In another moment Molly and May were
climbing into the small cart. May then shook
the reins and away they went, with the man
following close behind them.
</p><p>
They passed groups of jolly boys and girls
playing marbles, spinning tops, or rolling hoops.
They were clean, well-dressed children, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
ragged and poor like so many children Molly
and May had seen in other parts of the city.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i058.jpg" width="500" alt="boy racing goats" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Suddenly a little boy began to race with the goats</i></span></div>

<p>Smiling nurse maids pushed dear little babies
about in handsome carriages, or sat on shaded
benches watching the little children at their
play.
</p><p>
Everyone was interested in the small goat
cart with its happy passengers.
</p><p>
Suddenly a little boy who was rolling a
hoop began to race with the goats. He ran
along beside them, driving his hoop as fast as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
he could make it go. The goats did not want
to be left behind, so they trotted faster and
still faster, but the little boy with his rolling
hoop kept up with them.
</p><p>
The Sunbonnet Babies began to be a bit
frightened, they were riding so very fast. May
pulled on the reins and cried, "Whoa! whoa!
stop! stop!" The small Italian goats did not
understand English, so they ran faster than ever.
They were enjoying the race, and so was the
man who owned them. But when he saw that
his little passengers were afraid, he sprang forward
to stop his team. Just at that moment
the goats turned sharply about, and over went
the cart, Sunbonnet Babies and all.
</p><p>
Everybody was then really frightened, though
only for a moment. Molly and May were on
their feet in a jiffy. The boys and girls all
laughed and talked at the same time, and the
man scolded his goats for their naughty trick.
</p><p>
"Please don't scold the goats," said the little
boy with the hoop. "You ought to praise them.
They knew if you stopped them they would lose
the race, so they tried to turn around and go in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the other direction. Then the cart tipped over
and spoiled the fun."
</p><p>
"It was fun, wasn't it?" exclaimed Molly.
"But let's not do it over again. Let's have a
tea party now."
</p><p>
"Oh, yes! Let's have a tea party!" cried
May. "Here is a lovely place for it in front of
this pretty tea house. Who wants some grape
juice and some little cakes?"
</p><p>
"Oh, I do!" "And I do!" cried two happy
voices in real American English, for the little
boy with the hoop was an American, just like
the Sunbonnet Babies. And so they had the
jolliest tea party under the big trees in the
park that three little American children ever
had together, which is saying a very great deal.</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE BURIED CITY</h2>

<p class="p2">"Goody! This is the day we are going to
Pompeii!" cried May, as she opened her eyes
quite late next morning. "I hope father has not
forgotten his promise."
</p><p>
"Indeed he has not!" said her mother. "We
have the nicest kind of a surprise for you, but
we were afraid you were going to sleep all day."
</p><p>
"Oh, what is it? What is the surprise,
mother?" cried both little girls at once.
</p><p>
"It is something splendid, and it will last
a whole week, perhaps longer," said their mother.
"Each morning you shall hear about the surprise
for that day, but only for one day at a time."
</p><p>
"Please tell us what it is for to-day," begged
Molly. "What fun it will be to have a new
surprise every day!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
</p><p>
"Well," said their mother, "how would you
like to have a picnic dinner to-day?"
</p><p>
"Oh, we should like it better than anything
else we can think of!" exclaimed May. "But
I thought we were going to Pompeii to-day."
</p><p>
"We are," said their mother. "We shall
have our picnic in the prettiest place we can
find in old Pompeii. People do not live in the
ruined city now, for the houses have no roofs.
But father says they have the cunningest little
inhabitants he ever saw. They are part of the
surprise, so I must not tell about them now."
</p><div class='figright'><img src="images/i063.jpg" width="200" alt="picnic lunch" /></div>
<p>"Is the picnic basket ready,
mother?" asked Molly. "Is it
brimful of good things to eat?"
</p><p>
"Yes, everything is ready, and
Pietro will take us to the station
just as soon as you have had your breakfast."
</p><p>
After a short but very rough ride the train
stopped at a small station, and a man called,
"Pompeii!" as he walked quickly down the platform
unlocking the doors of the compartments.
</p><p>
As the Sunbonnet Babies stepped from the
train, they expected to see the famous ruined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
city, but they saw only a few whitewashed
houses which did not look ruined at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i064.jpg" width="500" alt="looking at Pompeii"/><br /><span class="caption"><i>Molly and May felt as if they were in another world</i></span></div>

<p>"O father!" cried Molly. "People are living
in this town. This can't be Pompeii."
</p><p>
"Yes it is," said her father. "This is new
Pompeii. The old city which we have come to
see is only a short walk from here."
</p><p>
When they finally passed through the gate
into the city, which had lain buried more than
seventeen hundred years, Molly and May felt
as if they were in another world. They walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
down the narrow, quiet streets, looking into
the empty shops and houses, trying to imagine
twenty thousand people living and working and
playing here so long, long ago. The smoking
volcano not far away made them wonder what
the people were doing when the hot ashes
buried their city.
</p><p>
The guide said many of the people probably
escaped, though some stayed to care for their
homes and were buried in them. He told how
a little mother bird was found sitting on her
nest, buried by the ashes. She would not leave
the little eggs that needed her wings for protection.
He told, too, how a Roman soldier
had been found standing at his place of duty
when all his friends had run for safety.
</p><p>
Many of the streets were not wide enough
for two small carriages to pass, and the sidewalks
were so narrow that the Sunbonnet Babies
could hardly walk side by side on them.
</p><p>
Molly and May thought it great fun to
jump across the streets on the high stepping-stones
which they found at every crossing. They
played they were dainty ladies of two thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
years ago who did not want to soil their pretty
shoes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i066.jpg" width="500" alt="walking on stepping stones in ruined city" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>It was great fun to jump across the streets on the high stepping-stones</i></span></div>

<p>At last they came to a house where a watchdog
with a rope around his neck lay in front
of the door. He looked rather fierce, but they
were not afraid, for the dog was not alive. He
was only the picture of a watchdog, made by
means of small black and white stones placed
close together in the sidewalk. Just below
him were two Latin words meaning "Beware
of the Dog."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i067.jpg" width="500" alt="girs in front of birdbath and statues" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The rooms all opened upon a lovely little garden and court</i></span></div>

<p>The outside walls of most of the houses had
no openings, except the front door, though some
had small shops on each side of the door, where
the owner carried on his business.
</p><p>
Molly and May stood behind the counter
in one of these shops and played they were
selling ripe figs to the passers-by. They went
through a small door into the house and found
that the rooms all opened upon a lovely little
court and garden, around which they were built.
</p><p>
This house was not so badly injured as some,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
so it looks much as it did when people lived
in it long ago. Everything has been left almost
as it was found when the ashes were taken out.
The little garden has been replanted with
flowers and green grass.
</p><p>
Around the four sides of the garden there is
a broad porch, and opening from the porch are
living rooms, bedrooms, and dining rooms. On
the walls are many pictures, which are almost
as beautiful as when they were first painted.
</p><p>
While they were walking about in this lovely
old house, May suddenly saw a queer little
animal. It was as green as grass, and it had
a long pointed tail and four big feet.
</p><p>
"What can it be?" she cried.
</p><p>
"I think I know," said Molly. "It is one
of the tiny inhabitants mother said we should
find here. I think it is a lizard. Look! There
are two more. How fast they run! They are
frightened. Poor little things!"
</p><p>
The guide gave a long, low whistle which made
the little lizards raise their heads and listen. He
whistled softly, until they had lost all fear,
standing very still while the Sunbonnet Babies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
touched their soft, green backs. Molly even
lifted one up gently by its long pointed tail.
But this frightened the little creature again, and
it jumped so hard it left its tail hanging between
Molly's fingers, while it ran across the garden
and up the wall of the porch, without any tail.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i069.jpg" width="500" alt="Molly holding lizard with May watching" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Molly lifted up a little lizard very gently by its long pointed tail</i></span></div>

<p>Poor Molly was now as frightened as the
little lizard, for she thought it would surely die
without its tail. But the guide said it would run
away and wait for another tail to grow, though
he thought lizards didn't like to lose their tails.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
</p><p>
Soon they came to the market place of the
old city, and the Sunbonnet Babies begged to
have their picnic dinner there. It was not like
any other picnic that Molly and May had
ever had. There were no trees to sit under,
and they were not allowed to build a bonfire.
But they made believe that the tall columns of
the old houses were great trees two thousand
years old, and they were sure Mount Vesuvius
was the biggest bonfire any picnic party ever had.
</p><p>
Before the afternoon was over, however, the
Sunbonnet Babies had seen enough of the dead
city. They were glad to leave it to the timid
little lizards, while they went to find a real
house in the new city of Pompeii where they
could spend the night.</p>

<h2 class="p2">A LONG DRIVE</h2>

<p class="p2">"What's the secret for to-day, mother?"
asked Molly very early next morning. "Are we
going to climb Mount Vesuvius?"
</p><p>
"I hope not," said her mother. "Solfatara
was bad enough for me. I don't want to go so
near to another volcano."
</p><p>
"Neither do I," said May. "But what <i>are</i>
we going to do, mother?"
</p><p>
"Father says he will tell us the secret at the
breakfast table, under the orange trees in the
garden. Who will be ready first?"
</p><p>
"I shall be!" cried Molly.
</p><p>
"No, I shall be!" cried May. "I am glad
we didn't go back to noisy Naples last night.
I love this dear little 'Tavern of the Sun'! I
believe the garden is the only parlor the hotel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
has. It is a really and truly sun parlor, isn't
it, mother?"
</p><p>
"We are ready for the secret, father," called
Molly, a few moments later, as she skipped
out into the lovely garden.
</p><p>
"Well, let us have some breakfast first.
Then we will have the secret," said her father.
</p><p>
"Look! We are going to have bread and
honey and delicious hot chocolate for breakfast,"
said Molly. "And best of all, we are going to
eat it under this lovely orange tree."
</p><p>
While they were enjoying the sweet taste
of the bees' honey and the sweet smell of the
orange blossoms, a more wonderful sweetness
came to their ears. It came from a tall, dark
tree near by. It was the sweetest bird's song
the little Americans had ever heard.
</p><p>
"O Maria! Please tell us the name of that
wonderful bird," they begged the pretty
Italian maid who brought them a fresh pot of
honey.
</p><p>
"Why, that is our nightingale," answered
Maria, laughing. "He has a nest somewhere
here in our garden. I think there must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
some little brown eggs in it now. During the
month of April he sings all day and all night,
except for two or three hours just after sunset.
Oh, we love our little nightingale!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i074.jpg" width="500" alt="Baby sitting at table in garden pointing at nightingale" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>A nightingale had a nest somewhere in the garden</i></span></div>

<p>"I love him, too!" cried Molly. "I wish
he would live in our garden trees at home."
</p><p>
"Well, children, are you ready for the
secret?" asked their father, at last. "Here is
Pippo, who wants to take us for a long drive."
</p><p>
"Is that the secret, father?" asked the
Sunbonnet Babies eagerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
</p><p>
"Yes, Pippo is going to take us on one of
the most beautiful drives in all the world. We
shall spend two days on the way, for we shall
not want to hurry."
</p><p>
A few moments later they were all seated
in a low Italian carriage, with Pippo on the
driver's seat, high in front of them. He cracked
his long whip many times above the backs of the
two small horses, but they seemed to like the
sound, for they dashed along over the hilly
road as if it were play.
</p><p>
After driving several hours over this lovely
mountain road they came to the beautiful blue
waters of the Gulf of Salerno. Now began the
most wonderful part of the drive. The road
followed the shore of the gulf, clinging all the
way to the steep slopes of the mountains, which
came close down to the water's edge.
</p><p>
Molly and May were wild with excitement
over the strangeness and beauty of it all.
Molly begged to sit up on the seat beside Pippo,
where she could see better and where he could
tell her all about the wonderful things they were
passing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
</p><p>
At first the mountains sloped gently away,
above and below the road. Small groves of
orange and lemon trees and vineyards of purple
grapes grew on the sunny slopes, while the blue
waters of the gulf sparkled like millions of
diamonds under the brilliant sunshine.
</p><p>
They passed tiny fishing villages where barefooted
women and little children seemed to be
the only inhabitants. The men were probably
away on fishing trips, or were sleeping lazily in
the shade. In one of the villages the Sunbonnet
Babies begged to stop and buy some oranges.
</p><p>
"O Pippo! Please ask if we may pick a few
oranges from that tree just above the road,"
begged May.
</p><p>
Pippo smilingly said a few words to a
woman standing near by, and she smilingly
answered, "Si, si, signor. As many as they wish."
</p><p>
Molly and May were out of the carriage in
a moment saying, "Grazie, grazie, signora!" as
they scrambled up the slope to a place where
they could reach the ripe, yellow fruit. The
woman kindly showed them the ripest and
juiciest oranges. Then she broke a small branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
from a higher part of the tree, and gave it with
a pretty bow to the little American girls.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i077.jpg" width="500" alt="eating oranges right off the tree" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"I never tasted anything so good as this orange"</i></span></div>

<p>"Look, May!" exclaimed Molly. "Here
are ripe oranges and green oranges and lovely
white blossoms all growing on the same branch.
I'm sure I never smelled anything so sweet as
these orange blossoms!"
</p><p>
"And I'm sure I never tasted anything so
good as this orange!" said May, who had
made a hole in one of her biggest oranges and
was eagerly sucking out the sweet juice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
</p><p>
"I wish I had something pretty to give the
woman," said Molly. "I know what I will do!
I will give her my hair ribbon. She may have a
little girl at home who will like it. Mother always
carries extra hair ribbons for us, you know."
</p><div class='figleft'><img src="images/i078.jpg" width="100" alt="bow for hair" /></div>
<p>So, out from under the pretty sunbonnet
came a big pink bow, which was
given quickly to the kind woman.
Into her other hand May slipped
something from her purse. A
moment later Pippo's long whip
cracked over the horses' heads, and they were off.
</p><p>
The children waved good-by to their new
friend, but she was looking with happy eyes
at the beautiful pink bow in one hand and at
the little piece of money in the other.
</p><p>
While Molly and May were busy gathering
oranges, their mother was opening the well-filled
lunch box. The next half-hour Pippo let his
horses go as slowly as they liked, while the
party in the carriage ate their picnic dinner and
enjoyed the lovely scenery. Of course Pippo
had his share of the lunch, which he seemed to
think was very fine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
</p><p>
By the middle of the afternoon they had
reached Amalfi, the largest and probably the
oldest fishing village on this rocky coast.
</p><p>
"We will spend the night in that old monastery
on the cliff," said the Sunbonnet Babies' father.
</p><p>
"Very well, sir," answered Pippo. "But
you will have a good many
steps to climb before you
get up there."
</p><div class='figleft'><img src="images/i079.jpg" width="200" alt="long steps up to monastary" /></div>
<p>The steps were very
soon found, nearly two
hundred of them, and up,
up, up the little party
climbed.
</p><p>
"How did the monks
ever build such a great
monastery 'way up here on the mountain
side?" exclaimed Molly. "It seems as if it
might fall into the water any minute."
</p><p>
"A piece of it did fall into the water a
few years ago," said a smiling Italian man who
was standing near by. "I saw it with my own
eyes. I was not much larger then than you
little girls are now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
</p><p>
"Oh, tell us about it, please!" begged the
Sunbonnet Babies.
</p><p>
"Well, it was this way," said the man.
"Our government spent a great deal of money
building the fine road over which you drove
to-day. The road had to be cut into the
side of the mountain nearly the whole distance
along this rocky shore. A broad stone wall was
built on the side next to the water, so that
carriages would not roll off. But there are
places between here and Sorrento where the
mountain is so steep the road could not be built
on the outside of it. It had to be cut through
the inside of the mountain. One of those places
is just below this old monastery. You will drive
through the tunnel in the morning when you
start on your journey again.
</p><p>
"Well," continued the little man excitedly,
"probably so much cutting away of the rock
weakened a part of the mountain on which the
monastery was built. One day, when the sun
was shining as lovely as it is now, we heard a
great ripping and splitting noise. It seemed
like an earthquake. But no, it was not an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
earthquake! It was a piece of the mountain
falling into the water below, carrying a small
end of the monastery with it. Oh, it was
terrible! I can never, never forget it!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i081.jpg" width="500" alt="girls overlooking lake and seeing tunnels in distance" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"I'm not sure that I want to drive through those dark tunnels"</i></span></div>

<p>"I'm sure I never could forget it, either,"
said Molly, who was almost crying.
</p><p>
"And I'm not sure that I want to drive
through those dark tunnels to-morrow," said
May.
</p><p>
"Well, let us explore the old monastery
now," said their father. "Then we will have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
our supper. Perhaps we shall find a few monks
still living here in some quiet corner."
</p><p>
Before they went to bed that night the
Sunbonnet Babies stood a long time at their
open window. A full moon hung high in the
sky, making the silvery blue water of the gulf
shimmer like a fairy sea. The little whitewashed
houses of the village clung to the side of the
dark mountain as if they feared some evil fairy
might push them down into the water.
</p><p>
Suddenly out of the evening silence came
the sound of music. Far below their window
the Sunbonnet Babies could see a young singer
with his mandolin. His clear, high voice gave
the lovely Italian song a strange beauty on
the evening air.
</p><p>
"Is it fairyland, or is it heaven?" Molly
whispered.
</p><p>
"Or are we just dreaming?" asked May, as
they crept into the little white beds that were
waiting for them.</p>

<h2 class="p2">PIRATES</h2>

<p class="p2">Next morning Molly and May were awake
early, watching the busy boats come home after
a long night of fishing out on the deep sea.
They ran down the many steps to the shore,
where the tired fishermen were hauling in their
nets and counting their catch. The big nets
were then spread out to dry. Later in the day
they would be carefully mended and made ready
for another night of fishing.
</p><p>
Their father told the children how Amalfi
was once one of the most important towns in
Europe. It sent its ships far away, and did
more trading with distant parts of the world
than was done by any other city.
</p><p>
But that was eight hundred years ago. Soon
Amalfi was overcome by the people of Pisa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
who were jealous of its power and trade.
And two hundred years later a terrible storm
and earthquake swept away nearly all of its fine
beach and harbor, leaving only a small group
of houses clinging to the steep mountain side.
</p><p>
So Amalfi changed from being one of the
most important towns in the world to one of
the least important, except for the beauty of its
location.
</p><p>
Thousands of people from all parts of the
world still go to Amalfi every year, but not to
buy and sell. They go to enjoy the wonderful
sunshine and water and mountains which make
this part of Italy one of the loveliest spots in
the world.
</p><p>
The Sunbonnet Babies were sorry when Pippo
said they must go on with their journey. They
wanted to stay and watch the women who were
washing clothes in the river, and they wanted
to follow a steep, narrow path which led away
up the mountain side. Some women and girls
were coming down this path bringing large
baskets of fruit on their heads.
</p><p>
But Pippo told the Sunbonnet Babies that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
best part of the drive was still ahead of them.
And he was right.
</p><p>
The road took them first through a short, dark
tunnel, not far below the monastery where they
had spent the night. It then clung to the sides
of the steepest mountains the children had ever
seen. Wonderful stone bridges led across deep
gorges, and dark tunnels took them inside the
mountains.
</p><p>
On one of the bridges which crossed a great
crack in the mountain side the Sunbonnet Babies
begged to get out of the carriage.
</p><p>
"Very well," said Pippo. "You will see an
interesting old fishing village in that gorge."
</p><p>
"What! A fishing village in that dark place,
Pippo?" exclaimed May.
</p><p>
"Yes," said Pippo, "but only a few fishermen
live there now. Their houses are really only
caves in the mountain wall."
</p><p>
"It looks as if pirates might live there,"
said Molly.
</p><p>
"Do you suppose they will come out and
steal us if we take a picture of their gorge?
I am going to try it anyway."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i087.jpg" width="500" alt="houses in canyons" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"It looks as if pirates might live there," said Molly</i></span></div>

<p>"You need not be afraid," said Pippo. "There
are no pirates here now; but once upon a time
they probably did live here. The gorge was a
fine place to hide in before this road was built."
</p><p>
It was hardly twenty miles from Amalfi to
Sorrento, but it took four hours to drive there.
The road finally left the shore and climbed up
over the green hills that separate the Gulf of
Salerno from the Bay of Naples. It led through
large vineyards and through groves of orange and
lemon and olive trees, until at last it reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the beautiful town of Sorrento. But Pippo did
not stop his horses until he had taken his party
to the prettiest and quaintest little whitewashed
hotel in the town.
</p><p>
The nicest thing about the hotel was its
garden. It seemed as if all the fruits and flowers
Molly and May had ever heard of were growing
in this garden.
</p><p>
The owner of the hotel peeped under the
big sunbonnets and said, "Well! well! I think you
belong in my garden. Run out and pick all the
oranges and all the roses you want. Find the
prettiest spot in the whole garden, and a little
round table shall be set there with a tea party
on it for the two sweetest little girls in Italy."
</p><p>
Such a wonderful time as the Sunbonnet
Babies had during the rest of that sunny afternoon.
They skipped along the shaded walks.
They picked handfuls of lovely flowers. They
filled their skirts with the ripest and biggest
oranges, then they sat down on a low marble
bench and sucked out the sweet juice.
</p><p>
The place which they chose for the tea party
was 'way at the end of the garden where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
they could look out over the lovely Bay of
Naples. As they peeped through the high iron
fence they looked straight down, at least a
hundred and fifty feet, to the blue water softly
washing the rocky shore below.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i089.jpg" width="500" alt="supper on a terrace" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They could look out over the lovely Bay of Naples</i></span></div>

<p>A delicious supper for two was set on a
small, round table. Then Molly served May
to chicken and rice, and May served Molly to
cakes and ice.
</p><p>
When they went to bed that night they both
agreed that it had been the happiest day of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the whole journey. But the next day brought
new surprises of which they hadn't yet dreamed.
</p><p>
First they explored the lovely old town of
Sorrento, and decided this was the place where
they wanted to live always. Only the promise
of a ride on the wonderful blue water of the
bay made them willing to leave Sorrento even
for a little while.
</p><p>
"How shall we get down to the water's edge?"
Molly asked, as they stood by the iron fence
looking down at the blue water so far below
them.
</p><p>
"I will show you the way," said a brown-eyed
Italian boy. "Come with me."
</p><p>
He then led them to a hole in the ground and
down some steep, winding steps. When they
reached the bottom of the steps they were in a
great cave close by the water's edge. Several
rowboats were lying in the cave, and two small,
dark-eyed men were standing near by.
</p><p>
Molly was sure this was a real pirates' cave.
When one of the dark-eyed men put her mother
into his boat and pushed it off into the water,
she burst into tears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i091.jpg" width="500" alt="Molly trying to rescue her mother" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>She ran toward the pirate, stamping her feet</i></span></div>

<p>"O father!" she cried. "They are carrying
mother off in that boat! They must not! They
shall not!"
</p><p>
She ran toward the pirate, stamping her
feet very hard and commanding him to take her
mother out of his boat. She was not crying
now. She was very brave. She would save
her mother and all the rest of her family from
the dreadful pirates.
</p><p>
As the small, dark man looked at her,
a smile came into his brown eyes. Then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
threw back his head and laughed a loud, merry
laugh.
</p><p>
"I really am not so bad a pirate as you
think I am, little girl," he said, after a moment.
"I have lived five years in your America, but I
wanted to come back to my sunny Italy. I
like the way you take care of your mother.
I believe you are brave enough to stop a
big ship out there on the bay and climb
aboard her, just as a real pirate might do."
</p><p>
"Oh, no, I am not!" said Molly. "I am
sure I am not!"
</p><p>
"Well, let's try it," said the man. "Your
father and mother are willing. I am sure you
will not object, if your little sister does not."
</p><p>
Now, May was clinging to her father's hand,
looking very frightened indeed.
</p><p>
"If you are really a <i>good</i> pirate," said Molly
at last, "and if you will not let anything
happen to us, we will go with you. But you
must take good care of my mother."
</p><p>
"I promise you I will," said the man. "But
remember, you must be as brave as pirates and do
as I tell you. I am the captain, you know."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i093.jpg" width="500" alt="all the family in a boat" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The waves were really quite high for so small a boat</i></span></div>

<p>So they obeyed their captain and got into
his boat. The two men then pushed the boat
out of the cave, pulling hard on the long oars.
</p><p>
The waves were really quite high for so
small a boat to ride over. But Molly and
May sat very still, wondering if they really
could be as brave as pirates. They were thinking
so hard they did not see a small steamer
coming down the bay, until it was quite close
to them. Then Molly said excitedly, "O
Captain! Captain! Is that the ship that I
must stop?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i094.jpg" width="500" alt="Molly waving a handkerchief" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Molly stood bravely waving her handkerchief</i></span></div>

<p>"That's the ship," answered the captain.
"You must stand right up here in the bow of
our boat and wave your handkerchief hard.
When the captain of that ship sees you, he will
know you are commanding him to stop his boat."
</p><p>
"But will he really stop it?" asked May.
</p><p>
"He wouldn't dare not to stop it," answered
the pirate captain. "He knows me, and when I
tell him to stop, he stops."
</p><p>
"How exciting!" cried Molly, as she stood
in the bow of the boat waving her handkerchief.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
</p><p>
"He is doing it! He is stopping his ship!"
cried May.
</p><p>
"Of course he is," said her captain. "Now
we must row our boat close up to the big one,
and you must all climb aboard her."
</p><p>
"Oh, we can never climb up over the side
of that big ship!" exclaimed May. "See how
our boat is tossing about. We shall be drowned!"
</p><p>
"Tut! tut! You must be as brave as your
little sister," said her captain.
</p><p>
"I will try to be brave," said May. And,
as their small boat tossed up and down on the
rough water close beside the taller ship, she
was very brave.
</p><p>
The sailors quickly opened a gate on the
deck and pushed out a short gangplank. Two
sailors then ran down to the end of the plank
and held out their arms to catch the little
pirates as they climbed aboard the ship.
</p><p>
Molly and May never knew just how it was
done, but in some way their captain swung them
from his small boat up onto the gangplank of
the big boat, and the sailors held them fast.
Their father and mother came up safely, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
and even their traveling bags were put onto the
steamer. They were hardly aboard, however,
when the ship began to move. The Sunbonnet
Babies looked quickly over the deck rail to see
why their pirate friends were not with them.
</p><p>
"They have left us!" exclaimed May. "They
are rowing back to their cave again!"
</p><p>
Sure enough, the two men were pulling
rapidly away from the big boat toward the shore.
When they saw the Sunbonnet Babies waving
to them, they smilingly took off their caps and
called "Addio, little pirates! Be brave and have
a happy time."</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE HUMPBACKED ISLAND</h2>

<p class="p2">"Where are we going, father?" demanded
Molly, as the boat which they had just come
aboard sailed slowly out toward the open sea.
</p><p>
"And why did we climb onto this steamer
'way out here in the deep water?" asked May.
</p><p>
"Oh, this is part of the surprise for to-day,"
answered their father. "Don't you like it?"
</p><p>
"Of course we like it," said Molly. "I even
like those pirates, though I am glad they have
gone back to their cave. But please tell us
where we are going, father."
</p><p>
"Well, we are bound for the island of Capri,
away off in the distance. It is about seven miles
from here."
</p><p>
"But why didn't this boat come to the shore
and get us?" asked May again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
</p><p>
"Just because the water close to the shore is
not deep enough for so large a boat to sail on,"
said her father.
</p><p>
"Did those men know you wanted to go
on this steamer?"
</p><p>
"Yes," answered her father. "It is their
business to bring out in their boats people who
want to go to Capri."
</p><p>
"Then they really are not pirates at all,"
said Molly in a disappointed voice.
</p><p>
"No, I am afraid not," answered her father.
"But they have helped you to play a real pirate's
trick. How did you like it?"
</p><p>
So they talked and asked questions as they
sailed on over the clear, blue water, until the sun
dropped suddenly behind the rim of the humpbacked
island. Then beautiful rainbow colors
were poured out over the sky and the sea and the
island. But soon the rose and golden tints
changed to silver and violet, and the rocky old
island looked like a great purple camel with a
double hump on its back, kneeling in a sea of
shimmering blue and lavender.
</p><p>
Between the humps nestled the pretty village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of old Capri, surrounded by lemon groves and
vineyards. High up on one of the humps
clung the little village of Anacapri, and close
down by the water's edge snuggled a few pink
and white and blue houses waiting to welcome
travelers who might come to their shore.
</p><p>
It would be hard to tell all that Molly
and May did and all that they saw during
four happy days on the island. The people of
Capri seem to live out of doors, for the warm
sunshine and fresh breezes make summer and
winter much alike there.
</p><p>
Some of the streets of the little old town
are no wider than American sidewalks, and most
of those that lead uphill have steps in them.
Long ago, when these streets were built, there
were no horses and carriages on the island.
People carried their heavy loads on their heads,
or on the backs of faithful donkeys.
</p><p>
Donkeys can climb stairs almost as well as
men, so they are still used a great deal on this
mountainous little island, for there are only
two or three roads that horses and carriages
can go over.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i101.jpg" width="500" alt="Molly and May meeting two children on donkeys" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Would the little girls like to ride on our donkeys?"</i></span></div>

<p>As the Sunbonnet Babies took their first walk
through the narrow streets, they met a boy and
girl coming down the hill on two small donkeys.
The boy sprang quickly to the ground. He
lifted his cap and said in polite Italian, with
much motioning of his hands, "Buon giorno,
signore. Would the little girls like to ride on
our donkeys?"
</p><p>
"Oh, thank you! Of course we should like
to ride," answered Molly very quickly.
</p><p>
"Please may we both ride?" asked May.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
</p><p>
"Yes, indeed!" said the little Italian girl,
jumping lightly from her donkey. "We will
take you over our whole island if you would
like to go with us."
</p><p>
"Goody!" exclaimed May. "Please take us
first very, very high up where we can look 'way
off over the blue sea toward America."
</p><p>
"We will take you up the long stairs to
Anacapri," said the boy. "I will get a carriage
for your father and mother, and they can drive
up over the fine new road."
</p><p>
The Sunbonnet Babies did not understand
all the boy's strange words, but they understood
some of them, and they each understood the
others' motion language. In a few moments
Molly was proudly seated on one of the small
donkeys and May on the other. Giorgio and
Luisa, the friendly Italian boy and girl, followed
close behind them, while the children's parents
rode comfortably along in a low carriage.
</p><p>
They had gone only a short distance, however,
when the two donkeys left the smooth
road and began to climb some steps cut into
the steep hillside. Giorgio and Luisa gave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
donkeys each a sound slap to keep them from
turning back, for donkeys are lazy animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i103.jpg" width="500" alt="girls riding donkeys with boy leading them" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The donkeys began to climb some steps cut in the hillside</i></span></div>

<p>Before the Sunbonnet Babies really knew
what was happening, their father and mother
were nearly out of sight around a bend in the
road, quite far below the steps up which the
donkeys were climbing.
</p><p>
"Father! Father! Where are you going?"
called May.
</p><p>
"We are going to the same place you are.
We are going to Anacapri," her father shouted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
back. "Let us see who will get there first.
Giorgio knows the way."
</p><p>
"They are going the long and easy way,
while we are going the short and steep way,"
Giorgio said, with much motioning. "If these
donkeys are not too lazy, we shall be there
first," and he gave them each another quick
rap on their backs with his hand.
</p><p>
"You should not strike your donkeys,
Giorgio," Molly said. "We can make them go
without your help."
</p><p>
"All right," said Giorgio, laughing. "You
may try it, but you will never reach Anacapri."
</p><p>
"Oh, yes, we shall!" answered Molly. "Just
watch us. Come on, May!"
</p><p>
Then they each pulled quickly on the short
reins, but the donkeys did not stir. They patted
the donkeys' necks and urged them to go on,
just as they did with their ponies at home, but
the donkeys only turned their heads and looked
with sleepy eyes at their strange little riders.
May's donkey even began to nibble the grass at
the side of the path. It acted as if it had no
thought of going up the hill, while Molly's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
donkey winked its eyes and stood very still,
in spite of all her efforts to make it move.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i105.jpg" width="500" alt="May's donkey eating grass next to steps" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>May's donkey began to nibble the grass at the side of the path</i></span></div>

<p>"O Giorgio!" she cried at last. "What are
we going to do? I never saw such stupid
animals. We shall never reach Anacapri. Father
and mother will think we are lost."
</p><p>
Giorgio and Luisa wanted very much to
laugh at their anxious little riders, but they
were too polite to do so.
</p><p>
"You see," Giorgio said, "our donkeys do
not like strange ways. They do not like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
have anyone but Luisa and me drive them.
They understand what we mean, and our blows
do not hurt them."
</p><p>
"Then please drive them now," said May.
"I don't want to sit here any longer."
</p><p>
So Giorgio and Luisa gave the donkeys
each a sound slap on their backs, which made
them swing their tails and start on up the long
steps. The donkeys stopped often to rest, but
they were reminded each time that their young
master and mistress were close behind them.
</p><p>
At last they reached the top of the steps,
and Giorgio and Luisa drove the donkeys
to a lovely garden where small tables were
set under the green trees.
</p><p>
"What a lovely place for a tea party!"
exclaimed May. "Let's have one ready for
father and mother when they come."
</p><p>
"Yes, let's have it at this table close by the
wall, where we can look down and see the lovely
water. My! It must be 'most a thousand feet
'way down there! See how tiny those boats
look, and what a wonderful color the water is!
It looks as if an artist had painted it that way."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i107.jpg" width="500" alt="tea party on another terrace" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"What a lovely place for a tea party!"</i></span></div>

<p>"Let's plan our tea party before mother gets
here," said May. "What fun it will be to
surprise her!"
</p><p>
So they asked the waiter to please bring
some grape juice, with bread and butter and
little cakes, enough for six people, for Giorgio
and Luisa were to share the party with them.
</p><p>
The carriage soon drew up to the garden
gate, and the Sunbonnet Babies ran to meet it,
calling: "Hello! hello! See, we are here first! Our
donkeys were so funny climbing up the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
stairs. They almost went to sleep, but Giorgio
and Luisa kept them moving. We are going to
have a tea party now. Come quickly, and look
over the garden wall. We never, never were
so high up above the water before!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i108.jpg" width="500" alt="boy and girl dancing" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>A young Italian boy and girl began to dance</i></span></div>

<p>As they were drinking their grape juice, a
young Italian boy and girl ran into the garden
and began to dance. Their mother made music
for them on an instrument that looked like the
head of a small drum, with little bells fastened
all around it. She tapped the instrument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
sharply with her fingers and jingled the little
bells.
</p><p>
The dancers were dressed in gay, pretty
costumes. They seemed to be telling each other
a happy love story by motions, glances, and
graceful dancing. It was the famous tarantella
dance which the people of Southern Italy love
so much.
</p><p>
When the dancers had finished their story,
Molly and May gave them each some grape
juice and little cakes. Then they rode back
down the hill on their two sleepy donkeys.
</p><p>
The next day the Sunbonnet Babies were
given a wonderful boat ride all the way around
the island of Capri. In many places the shore
rose from the blue water very steep and high.
Gay-colored jellyfish floated about, and little
forests of red coral clung to the rocky wall
just below the water's edge.
</p><p>
When they had sailed nearly around the
island, their steamer stopped quite suddenly,
and they were told they must all get into some
small rowboats that were waiting near by.
</p><p>
"What is the trouble?" asked May excitedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
"Is our boat sinking? Have these men come
to rescue us, father? The shore is much too
steep for us to land here, isn't it?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i110.jpg" width="500" alt="girls at railing pointing to man in boat" /><br /><span class="caption">"<i>There is a man who wants to take us in his boat</i>"</span></div>

<p>"Oh, no!" said her father. "Our boat is not
sinking, but we are going to take a look at the
inside of the island. The Overall Boys saw
the inside of a glacier up in Switzerland, you
know."
</p><p>
"Oh, goody!" exclaimed Molly. "See, there
is a man who wants to take us in his boat.
Please, can't we hurry?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i111.jpg" width="500" alt="sitting low in the boat to fit into passage" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They had to keep their heads low to slip through the opening</i></span></div>

<p>A few moments later they were being rowed
straight toward a low hole in the steep shore.
The hole was not more than three feet high
and three feet wide above the surface of the
water. It led into a narrow passage about
fifteen feet long, which was just large enough
for a rowboat to slip through if heads were
kept very low.
</p><p>
"Oh, my! Where are we going?" whispered
May, as she lay very still in the bottom of
the boat. "This is more dangerous than going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
inside of a glacier. I know it is! I wish the
Overall Boys were here!"
</p><p>
"Heads up!" called the boatman. "You
are now in the beautiful Blue Grotto, the most
wonderful chamber in Italy."
</p><p>
The next few moments no one spoke. The
Sunbonnet Babies were sure they were dreaming,
or that they had fallen asleep while lying in
the bottom of the boat and had wakened in
the land of the water nymphs.
</p><p>
Molly peeped gently over the edge of the
boat, hoping to see a pretty nymph swimming
about in the wonderful greenish-blue water.
Just then a slender figure sprang from a narrow
ledge at the farther side of the cave.
</p><p>
"Look, Molly!" whispered May. "It <i>is</i> a
nymph&mdash;a really, truly nymph! It has gone
way down under the water. The water is so
clear and light we can see everything in it. It
looks as deep as the sky."
</p><p>
"See, the nymph is coming up now!" said
Molly eagerly. "What a beautiful color it is!
It is diving and splashing and playing, just like
a real boy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i113.jpg" width="500" alt="girls in boat seeing swimmer in passage" /><br /><span class="caption">"<i>Look! It is a nymph!</i>"</span></div>

<p>"And it is a real boy," said their father.
"He is showing you the wonderful light and
color in the water."
</p><p>
"Oh! Would I look as beautiful as that if
I should swim in this water?" Molly asked
eagerly.
</p><p>
"And would I?" cried May.
</p><p>
"Put your hand into the water and see,"
her father answered.
</p><p>
In a moment four little hands were splashing
in the clear water. They were no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the rosy hands of Molly and May. They
looked like white marble hands, softly tinted
with blue. The drops of water that fell from
their fingers were like strings of lovely opals
and sapphires. The children wanted to catch
some of the drops to carry home, but the boat-man
said they would look just like any other
water drops out in the sunshine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i114.jpg" width="500" alt="looking over the edge of boat at shimmering water" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The drops of water were like strings of lovely opals</i></span></div>

<p>"But what makes them look so strange and
lovely in this grotto?" asked Molly.
</p><p>
"Perhaps because most of the light that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
comes into the grotto shines through the water,"
said her father. "In some way the red and
orange and yellow rays of the sunlight have
been lost, but the blue and green and violet
rays seem to be all here. So everything looks
cool and blue instead of warm and rosy, as it
does just outside."
</p><p>
"How was such a great cave ever made
under this island?" asked May. "Did the
Italians make it?"
</p><p>
"No, indeed!" answered the boatman. "The
sea made it ages and ages ago. This cave used
to be a resort for the Roman emperors and
their friends two thousand years ago. One
emperor about that time built wonderful palaces
on the island, and on hot summer days he and
his friends would come down into this cool
grotto to swim and to rest. Since then the
island has sunk a little, so the water in the
grotto is higher than it used to be. But even
now the walls of the cave are forty feet high
and a hundred and seventy feet long. It is
almost as large as a good-sized church, you
see."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
</p><p>
"But the door is only three feet high," said
Molly. "What would happen if a big storm
came up while we were in here?"
</p><p>
"We couldn't get out," said the boatman.
"Boats are not allowed to come into the grotto
unless the sea is perfectly quiet. When it is
rough it is very dangerous to be in here. We
are allowed to stay only fifteen minutes, and
our time is up now."
</p><p>
So they tossed a shining silver piece to the
little boy who had made them think he was a
really, truly water nymph, and their boats
slipped quickly through the narrow passage
back into the bright Italian sunshine.</p>

<h2 class="p2">IN THE CITY OF ROME</h2>

<p class="p2">"I feel as if vacation time were over," said
Molly, a few days later, as she looked from
their window out upon a busy street in Rome.
"I should much rather play in the orange
garden at Sorrento or climb over the island
of Capri with Giorgio and Luisa than to see
Rome."
</p><p>
"So should I!" said May. "I am sure there
can't be any more surprises as nice as the ones
we have had."
</p><p>
"Oh, yes, there can be!" said their father, who
overheard what his Sunbonnet Babies were talking
about. "There is one big surprise coming,
which I believe you will think is even nicer than
Sorrento or Capri."
</p><p>
"O father! Is it here in Rome?" asked May.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
</p><p>
"No," answered her father. "Not the surprise
I am thinking about, though there are many
nice ones here. We can drive about the city a
little now, and see what it looks like."
</p><p>
"That will be fun," said Molly. "I hope
the streets will not be so noisy and dirty as
they were in Naples."
</p><p>
They were soon driving through broad streets
and narrow streets, through streets where electric
cars were speeding along, through old, old
streets, and through big beautiful squares. It
seemed as if they passed more great stone
churches and handsome fountains than they had
seen in all their lives before.
</p><p>
Their driver stopped his carriage near one of
the largest of the fountains and said they should
each throw a penny into the basin of water
and take a drink from it before leaving Rome.
Then they would surely visit the city again,
for the legend says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Cast your obulus in Trevi's fountain,</p>
<p class="i2">Drink and, returning home,</p>
<p>Pray that by stream or desert, vale or mountain,</p>
<p class="i2">All roads may lead to Rome.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"I am not sure yet that I want to come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
to Rome again," said Molly. "I think I will not
throw my penny into the fountain until the last
day I am here."
</p><p>
"I will show you something that will make
you want to come again," said the driver. "I
know what the Americans like."
</p><p>
He then drove them through more narrow
streets, until they came to a large square with
a fountain in the center of it. This fountain
looked like an old Roman war vessel.
</p><p>
Already the Sunbonnet Babies had learned
that in Italy a public square is called a <i>piazza</i>,
and their driver told them that this square was
the Spanish Piazza.
</p><p>
"It should be called the Flower Piazza!"
exclaimed May. "It looks like a big flower
market. May we buy some of those lovely
cherry blossoms?"
</p><p>
"Yes, indeed! Buy all you want," said their
driver. "This is only one of our flower markets.
There are many others in the city."
</p><p>
"Why are the people waiting on those great
stone steps?" asked Molly. "And why do they
wear such odd, pretty clothes?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i121.jpg" width="500" alt="girls at flower cart in Rome" /><br /><span class="caption">"<i>It should be called the Flower Piazza!</i>"</span></div>

<p>"Those people are models for artists," answered
their driver. "Many of them live in the country
and come into the city every pleasant morning.
They wait on these steps, hoping artists may
come and ask them to pose for their pictures.
They are dressed in the old Roman costumes."
</p><p>
"I like their costumes," said May. "I wish
your people would all dress that way. How
nice that little girl looks with her bright-colored
apron and red coral beads. She is barefooted
and bareheaded, too."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i122.jpg" width="500" alt="watching girl running down steps with jar on her head" /><br /><span class="caption">"<i>Isn't she lovely?</i>"</span></div>

<p>"See, she is running down the steps with
a tall jar on her head. Isn't she lovely? I
wonder if she will let us take her picture."
</p><p>
"I will ask her," said May. "Do you suppose
that woman is her mother? She is knitting
with long, crooked needles. Her cap looks like
a white handkerchief laid over her black hair.
Perhaps they think father and mother are artists
who want to paint them in a picture."
</p><p>
"I will tell them that my little daughters
are the artists," said the Sunbonnet Babies'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
father. "It does not take you so long to make
a picture as it does most artists, so I think they
will be glad to pose for you."
</p><p>
And they were. When the camera had been
snapped, Molly and May each gave the little girl
a <i>soldo</i> and said they hoped a real artist would
paint a beautiful picture of her soon.
</p><p>
"I should much rather see the picture you
have just taken in your queer, black box," said
the little Italian girl.
</p><p>
"Would you really like to have us send it to
you when it is finished?" asked Molly.
</p><p>
"Oh, yes, thank you! I would take it home
to <i>il padre</i> and show him what happens when
I come to the big city."
</p><p>
"Where do you live?? asked the Sunbonnet
Babies' father.
</p><p>
"We live in the country, two miles beyond
the city walls. We go out through St. Paul's
Gate. My father has a little farm out there."
</p><p>
"May we drive out to see you some day?"
asked the Sunbonnet Babies' father again.
</p><p>
"We should be proud to have you do so,
sir," answered the little girl's mother politely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
</p><p>
"We will come next Friday afternoon, if you
will be at home that day."
</p><p>
"And we will bring the picture we have just
taken," Molly said to her smiling little friend.
</p><p>
"Please tell us what your name is," said May.
</p><p>
"My name is Maria," answered the little
girl brightly.
</p><p>
"Why, that is the Italian name for Mary,
isn't it? My name is May."
</p><p>
"Addio, Maria! Here are some cherry blossoms
for you, and here is a bunch of kisses. Addio!"
</p><p>
Then they drove away, blowing kisses from
the tips of their small fingers to the lovely little
model standing on the Spanish Flower Steps.
</p><p>
Soon they came to a handsome bridge which
crossed the river Tiber. Their driver said this
bridge was built by the famous Emperor Hadrian
in the year 136. At the end of the bridge was
a great round castle, which was also built by
Emperor Hadrian, as a burial tomb for himself.
</p><p>
Three hundred years ago ten large stone
angels were placed on each side of the long
bridge, and another angel was put high on top of
the round castle. Since then Hadrian's Tomb is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
often called the Castle of the Holy Angels, and
the bridge is called the Bridge of the Holy Angels.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i125.jpg" width="500" alt="in carriage on bridge" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The Bridge of the Holy Angels</i></span></div>

<p>As Molly and May drove slowly across this
fine old bridge between the two rows of angels,
they felt very small and very young indeed.
</p><p>
"I wonder if any of the bridges in America
will last eighteen hundred years," Molly said
thoughtfully. "And what do you suppose the
boys and girls were like in those days?"
</p><p>
"I believe they were very much like the
Roman children to-day," said her father. "And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
I am sure those old Roman men must have
been very wise to build such fine bridges as this
one. In a few moments we shall see the largest
church in all the world."
</p><p>
"Why, I thought the largest buildings were
all in America," said May.
</p><p>
"The largest and tallest business buildings
are there," said her father, "but not the largest
churches. Half a dozen of the big churches in
New York City could be set down right inside
the Cathedral of St. Peter's, and forty thousand
people can walk about in the Cathedral and not
be crowded at all."
</p><p>
"Oh, dear! We shall get lost in such a big
place!" exclaimed May.
</p><p>
But when they were once inside the great
cathedral, it did not seem so large as they had
expected. Not until they had walked around
one of the great pillars which support the high
dome did they realize how very, very large the
cathedral was. They had to take as many
steps in walking around that one pillar as they
would have taken in walking around their own
home in America. And there were four of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
great pillars, besides many smaller ones. On
some of the pillars there were marble figures of
babies as large as men, and figures of men as
large as giants, while each of the many chapels
along the two sides of the cathedral were the
size of small churches.
</p><p>
"Is this great church named for St. Peter
whom we read about in the Bible?" asked Molly.
</p><p>
"Yes," answered her father. "And he is
supposed to be buried under this beautiful altar.
See, there is an old bronze statue of him on the
side of that pillar."
</p><p>
"And look! A woman is lifting up her baby
to kiss the foot of the statue!" exclaimed May.
"Why is she doing that, father?"
</p><p>
"She wants to show her honor and love for
St. Peter. And she wants to teach her child
to honor him, too," said her father. "One of
the great bronze toes is nearly worn away, so
many people have kissed it. Now are you ready
to do something almost as hard as climbing a
mountain?"
</p><p>
"Of course we are! We are ready for anything.
What is it, father?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
</p><p>
"Follow me and you will soon find out."
</p><p>
Then they all passed through a small door on
one side of the great church and began to go
up some broad, winding stairs. They climbed
up and up and up, until it seemed as if they
could not climb any higher.
</p><p>
"Would you rather have come up these
stairs on a donkey?" asked their father at last.
</p><p>
"Oh, dear! I don't know," said Molly,
laughing. "I guess the Capri donkeys could
come up here all right, but I think I'd rather
be on my own feet. A donkey might get tired
and lie down, or turn around and go back."
</p><p>
"Well, here is a resting place for us," said
her father. "We have climbed as far as the base
of the great dome. We can walk around the
gallery now and look down into the church
where we stood only a little while ago."
</p><p>
"How tiny the people look 'way down
there! And how high the great dome still is
above us!" exclaimed May.
</p><p>
"It is more than two hundred feet from
this gallery to the top of the dome," said her
father. "Shall we climb up there?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i129.jpg" width="500" alt="father carrying on girl and holding the hand of the other" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>He carried his little girls by turns</i></span></div>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Molly, who had courage
for anything.
</p><p>
Their father did not want the little legs to
grow too tired with the long climb, so he carried
his two little Sunbonnet Babies by turns up the
last part of the steep, winding stairs, until they
stood on a small open gallery above the great
dome.
</p><p>
The whole city of Rome lay spread out before
them like a great map. They could see the
new city with its fine buildings, and the older
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
city with its narrow streets and crowded houses,
and the still older, dead city, which had lain
buried many centuries and now looked very
much like old Pompeii.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i130.jpg" width="500" alt="girls overlooking the city" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The whole city of Rome lay spread out before them</i></span></div>

<p>There was the river Tiber with its muddy
water flowing lazily along between the crowded
houses. And not far away was the Tomb of
Hadrian and the handsome Bridge of the Holy
Angels. Their father pointed out parts of the
ancient stone wall which once surrounded the
whole of old Rome, and St. Paul's Gate, through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
which Maria said they must drive in going to
visit her father's farm.
</p><p>
Beyond the old city wall they could see miles
and miles of level farms and pastures, and away
in the distance rose a line of dark mountains
against a blue sky. It was a big and wonderful
view, but Molly and May soon became more
interested in what they saw on the great, flat
roof of the cathedral just below them.
</p><p>
"It looks like a little village down there,"
said May. "Is it really the roof of the cathedral?"
</p><p>
"It really is," answered her father. "Those
men are busy repairing different parts of the
cathedral and the great palace buildings. They
say there are eleven hundred rooms in that
palace. There are art galleries and museums
and chapels in it, and it is also the home of
the Pope, who is the head of the Catholic Church.
We must visit the art galleries some day. There
are many beautiful things in them."
</p><p>
"Look, father!" cried May at last. "How
dark the sky is growing! It is going to rain."
</p><p>
"I am afraid it is," said her father. "We
must leave this hilltop and hurry to our hotel."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
</p><p>
A few moments later they were out on the
beautiful piazza in front of the cathedral. It
had already begun to sprinkle, but they found
a carriage and driver waiting to take them
wherever they wanted to go.
</p><p>
"I am sure it will rain hard before we can
reach the hotel," said their mother. "How
would you like to drive to a restaurant near by
and have one of our nice tea parties?"
</p><p>
"Oh, we should love it!" exclaimed Molly
and May. "It is hungry work to climb so high."
</p><p>
After a tea party of hot chocolate and
bread and butter, they were rested once more.
The shower had passed, and they had a wonderful
time buying Roman beads and sashes and
hair ribbons in the gay little shops along the
busy street.

<h2 class="p2">THE STORY OF THE TWINS</h2>

<p class="p2">"Shall we visit the very oldest part of the
city to-day?" asked the Sunbonnet Babies'
father one morning.
</p><p>
"Oh, dear! I am tired of old things," said
May. "I should much rather ride in the park
and hear the band play, as we did yesterday."
</p><p>
"Don't you like to hear old stories?" asked
her father.
</p><p>
"Why, yes! I always like stories, you know."
</p><p>
"Well, wouldn't you like to hear an old
story about some twin boys? And while I tell
the story, wouldn't you like to sit near the place
where the boys were supposed to have grown up?"
</p><p>
"Yes, of course we should!" exclaimed
Molly. "I like old things, father. You tell
such interesting stories about them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
</p><p>
Half an hour later they were walking
slowly about the old Roman Forum looking at
ruins of beautiful buildings and temples which
had once been the center of the busy city. In
one of the narrow streets they saw some large
squares and circles made in the pavement, on
which the men and boys used to play their
games.
</p><div class='figright'><img src="images/i135.jpg" width="250" alt="Colosseum" /></div><p>
They saw, too, the great open-air theater, or
Colosseum, in which the old Romans held their
famous sports. Sometimes
the sports were very wicked
and cruel. The Colosseum
was built in the shape of a
huge circle without a roof.
It once seated eighty-seven thousand people
around its high sides, leaving a large open
space in the center for the games.
</p><p>
Then they saw beautiful great arches, built
in honor of old emperors, and tall marble
columns which were once a part of lovely
temples. But these things were all so broken
and ruined the Sunbonnet Babies soon grew
tired of looking at them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i136.jpg" width="500" alt="Girls and father looking at ruins" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They saw beautiful arches and tall marble columns</i></span></div>

<p>"When are you going to tell us the story,
father?" asked May at last.
</p><p>
"Well, let us have it now," answered her
father. "Let us sit down on this old stone
block right where we can look at the hill over
yonder. The present city of Rome is built on
seven hills. Our story tells how the city was
first started on that hill and how the first wall
was built around it."
</p><p>
"Is the story really true, father?" asked
May.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
</p><p>
"People used to think it was true, but it
happened such a long time ago we cannot be
sure about it. Even if it is not true, it is a
good story about twin brothers who were said
to have lived nearly three thousand years ago.
The father of the boys was supposed to have
been the young god Mars, and their mother
was a beautiful maiden called Sylvia.
</p><p>
"It was Sylvia's work to care for the sacred
fire in the temple of the goddess Vesta. Such
maidens were treated with great honor, but they
were not allowed to marry. So the people were
very angry when Sylvia said the great god
Mars was her husband and the two baby boys
were her own little children. As a punishment
the young mother was buried alive, and her
helpless babies were put into a wooden trough,
which was set afloat on the river Tiber.
</p><p>
"Now it happened just at that time that
the river overflowed its banks. But very soon
the water went down, and the little trough in
which the twin babies lay was left safely on
high ground. Of course the babies became
very hungry and probably cried loudly for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
their mother to come and feed them. But the
poor mother could not come, though another
mother did. She was a mother wolf, and she
carried the hungry babies away to her lair,
where she tenderly nursed and cared for them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i138.jpg" width="500" alt="twin babies in trough on hill" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The little trough in which the babies lay was left safely on high ground</i></span></div>

<p>"Some time later a shepherd found the
baby boys living in the woods with their
wolf mother. He was a kind man, and he
took the children home to his wife. She named
the boys Romulus and Remus, and brought
them up to be shepherds like her husband.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
</p><p>
"When the twin brothers grew to be young
men, trouble arose between the shepherds
belonging to their mother's father, who should
have been king of the country, and the shepherds
of the wrongful ruler. Romulus and Remus did
many brave things of which their grandfather
heard, and one day he asked to have them
brought before him. He then discovered that
they were the twin sons of his beautiful
daughter Sylvia.
</p><p>
"The proud young men gathered an army
together at once and seized the country in the
name of their grandfather, the rightful king.
They then decided to build a city, but they
could not agree upon a place for it.
Romulus wished to build it on one of the seven
low hills in that region, while Remus wished
to build it on another. Finally they went to
their grandfather for advice, and he told them
to watch for a sign from the gods. So
Romulus stood on the hill which he had chosen
and Remus stood on his hill, both watching
for some sign to show them the right spot on
which to build their city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i140.jpg" width="500" alt="Remus standing on hill seeing vultures flying over" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Remus saw six vultures flying over his head</i></span></div>

<p>"At last Remus saw six vultures flying
over his head, but shortly afterward Romulus
saw twelve vultures. The people took this to
be a sign that the gods preferred the choice of
Romulus, so they made him their king.
</p><p>
"Romulus began at once to build the walls
of his new capital. He harnessed a heifer and
a bull to a plow, and between the rising and
going down of the sun he plowed a furrow in
the shape of a square around the top of his hill.
On this furrow he built the wall of his city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
</p><p>
"Remus had seen the birds first and he felt
that he should be the founder of the city.
One day, as he stood watching the building of
the new wall, he laughed at it scornfully and
leaped over it. Romulus was deeply hurt, and
he killed his brother on the spot, crying, 'So
may all perish who cross this wall!'
</p><p>
"Romulus named his city <i>Rome</i>, and he and
his shepherds lived in thatch-roofed mud houses
within the protection of its walls.
</p><p>
"The story says this was the real beginning
of the wonderful city of Rome. The hill which
Romulus chose was the one right over there.
It is called the Palatine Hill. The old Roman
emperors lived on it for many centuries. The
ruins of their walls and great palaces can still
be seen," said the Sunbonnet Babies' father, as
he finished his story.
</p><p>
"I wonder if it was there that the mother
wolf took care of Romulus and Remus," said
Molly. "If so, I think Romulus was right in
wanting to build his city on the same spot."
</p><p>
"Rome is now so large it covers all of
the seven hills, as well as the land between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
them," said her father. "Our hotel is on one
of the hills, and the park where we drove
yesterday is on another. Who wants to drive in
the park again to-day?"
</p><p>
"I do!" and "I do!" and "I do!" cried
Molly and May and their mother.
</p><p>
"Please may we drive first through the
Spanish Piazza and buy some more flowers?"
begged May. "Perhaps we may find Maria
on the big steps. If she is there, father, may
we ask her to drive in the park with us?"
</p><p>
"Yes, indeed!" answered her father. "We
may meet the king and queen in the park.
They drive there nearly every day."
</p><p>
"Oh! oh!" exclaimed May. "Let's buy the
loveliest roses we can find and toss them into
the king's carriage."</p>

<h2 class="p2">TRAVEL ADVENTURES</h2>

<p class="p2">The next few days were spent in traveling
northward, sometimes by train, sometimes by
automobile, and sometimes behind two small
Italian horses.
</p><p>
Each night the Sunbonnet Babies slept in
some quaint little town near a great old church
or castle built hundreds of years ago.
</p><p>
Some of the towns stood on steep, rocky
hills and were surrounded by strong, stone
walls. There was always a village well within
the walls, where the women and girls filled their
graceful jugs with water every morning.
</p><p>
During spring and summer the men and
women in these hillside towns work on their
fertile little farms in the green valleys below.
In the fall the children take long trips to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
woods to gather ripe chestnuts to grind into
flour, for the Italians are very fond of chestnut
cakes.
</p><p>
The most wonderful thing which Molly and
May saw on this northward journey was the
Leaning Tower at Pisa.
</p><div class='figright'><img src="images/i145.jpg" width="200" alt="tower of Pisa" /></div><p>
For seven hundred years the beautiful white
marble tower has
stood there leaning
lazily over to one
side. Soon after it
was started, the
ground under it began
to sink. The
builders straightened
it up as well
as they could, but when it was finished its top
leaned to one side nearly fourteen feet.
</p><p>
The Sunbonnet Babies were almost afraid
to go up the winding stairs inside the Leaning
Tower. But at last they bravely climbed the
three hundred steps, round and round and up
and up, until they reached the top where the
great bells hang.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
</p><p>
Even though a strong railing was around
the top of the tower, Molly and May thought
they would surely slip off, it leaned so far to
one side. But they soon forgot their fears.
</p><p>
Near by they saw the great black and white
cathedral and the beautiful round baptistry
where the babies of Pisa are all baptized.
</p><p>
Toward the west they looked across broad,
green fields to the blue sea seven miles away.
Two thousand years ago the sea was only two
miles from Pisa, but the river Arno, which
flows down from the mountains, brings with it
a great deal of soil which it drops when it
reaches the sea. In this way five miles of new
land have been made between Pisa and the sea.
</p><p>
There was not much except the Leaning
Tower in the now quiet little city of Pisa to
interest the Sunbonnet Babies, so they followed
the river Arno up toward the mountains as far
as the beautiful city of Florence.
</p><p>
It was Maytime, and there were roses
everywhere&mdash;roses to sell and roses to give
away. For the first time in their short lives
Molly and May had all the roses they wanted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i147.jpg" width="500" alt="girls talking to boy carrying yoke of buckets full of roses" /><br /><span class="caption">"<i>Will you please let me sell your roses for you?</i>"</span></div>

<p>"No wonder Florence is called the City of
Flowers," said their mother one morning, as
they visited the big flower market.
</p><p>
"Yes, everybody seems to be buying or
selling flowers. Isn't it lovely?" cried Molly.
</p><p>
Then, before her parents knew what she
was doing, Molly ran up to a small boy who
was carrying two baskets of beautiful roses on
a wooden yoke across his shoulders.
</p><p>
"O little boy!" she said. "Will you please
let me sell your roses for you? I will give you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
all the money I make. I should love to sell
them!"
</p><p>
"And so should I!" cried May. "Father,
please ask him if we may sell his flowers for
him," for the small boy could not quite understand
what the little American girls wanted.
</p><p>
A few words from their father, however,
brought a happy smile to the boy's face. This
was enough for the Sunbonnet Babies. In a
moment Molly was standing beside one of the
flower baskets and May beside the other, with
the radiant little Italian boy between them.
</p><p>
"Now," said Molly, "you hold the baskets
while we sell the flowers. We will sell some
to our own father first. Please, sir, here is a
bunch of pink roses for you. They cost only
one lira. I am sure you want them."
</p><p>
Of course he did want them, and many
other people wanted to buy of the pretty
little flower girls, too.
</p><p>
In a very few minutes the two baskets
were empty, and the small boy was hurrying
away to his father's flower stand with more
money in his pocket than he had ever had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
before, while Molly and May found other
interesting things to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i149.jpg" width="500" alt="Girls watching top maker" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They watched Filippo spin his tops</i></span></div>

<p>From a corner of the market place they
heard some one calling, "Ecco! Signor Filippo
will now present his troup of trained tops for
the crippled soldiers."
</p><p>
"Oh, let's see them!" exclaimed May.
"Tops are such fun, and we ought to help the
poor Italian soldiers, too."
</p><p>
So they watched young Filippo, who had been
a soldier in the great war, spin his wonderful tops.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
</p><p>
They were military tops which Filippo had
made himself. There was an American soldier,
an Italian soldier, a British soldier, and a French
soldier. Then there was a Red Cross nurse and
a jolly sailor boy. But prettiest of all was a
dainty little girl with butterfly skirts, dancing
gracefully about among the stiff soldiers.
</p><p>
It was really wonderful, the way Filippo
kept the tops spinning. Molly and May paid
him a whole lira for the fun they had in
watching them.
</p><div class='figleft'><img src="images/i150.jpg" width="96" alt="bird cage" /></div><p>
As they were about to leave the
market place they heard a clear, beautiful
whistle which made them stop
and listen.
</p><p>
"It is my blackbird, signorine,"
called a little boy. "See, he is here
in this cage. I caught him in the field and
taught him how to whistle. Now he can whistle
better than any other blackbird in Florence.
Would you like to buy him?"
</p><div class='figright'><img src="images/i151.jpg" width="200" alt="donkey with bundle of sticks walking on side of hill" /></div><p>
"Why, yes, of course we should! But we cannot
take care of a bird while we are traveling.
He will be happier with you. We will give you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
some pennies to buy food for him." So they
dropped two big Italian pennies into the little
boy's hat, while he bowed
very politely.
</p><p>
One whole lovely
afternoon was spent in
motoring over the hills
beyond the city of
Florence. They saw
groves of olive trees that
were hundreds and hundreds
of years old, and
large vineyards where purple grapes were
growing.
</p><p>
On a hilly road beyond a small village
they passed two women who were bringing
down from the woods great bundles of fagots on
the backs of small donkeys. They would burn
these fagots in their fireplace stoves at home,
for wood and coal are hard to get in Italy.
</p><p>
Best of all the things the Sunbonnet Babies
saw on this happy drive was a rollicking brook.
It came tumbling down over big stones and
under white birch trees close by the roadside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Beyond the brook was a trim little wheat
field, bright with scarlet poppies.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i152.jpg" width="500" alt="mother and girls standing up in back of car looking at fields" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Beyond the brook was a wheat field bright with poppies</i></span></div>

<p>"It looks just like a brook I know in New
England," said their mother. "Let us walk a
little way and find out where it comes from."
</p><p>
"Oh, yes! Let's walk!" cried Molly and
May and their father.
</p><p>
So they left their car and began following
the brook under the shade of the tall trees.
The children picked handfuls of scarlet poppies
and beautiful blue cornflowers. They listened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
to the happy nightingales and mocking birds
singing in the trees above them, and they
watched handsome great dragon flies dart
along close above the cool, splashing water.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i153.jpg" width="500" alt="dragonflies and butterflies" /></div>

<p>On and on they walked, until at last they
came to a beautiful, quiet spot shut in by
trees and bushes, with only the brook flowing
through it.
</p><p>
"What a splendid place for a picnic!" cried
May. "How I wish we had something to eat!"
</p><p>
"I have some small cakes of sweet chocolate,"
said her mother. "Perhaps a good fairy will
come along and change them into strawberry
sandwiches for us. Let us sit down on the
grass and see."
</p><p>
So they all sat down by the the brook and
their mother divided the little round cakes of
chocolate among them. They each had three.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i154.jpg" width="500" alt="mother sitting on grass with May and Molly watching" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Sh-h! I believe the fairy is coming!"</i></span></div>

<p>"Sh-h! I believe the fairy is coming,"
whispered May. "I hear footsteps!"
</p><p>
At that moment the bushes were pushed
gently aside and a little, barefooted old woman
peeped smilingly through at them. A small,
brown-eyed girl was with her. She was
barefooted, too, and they each wore a wreath of
grape leaves around their flying hair. The
little girl had a bunch of fresh grape leaves in
her hand, and the little old woman carried a
small basket of luscious wild strawberries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i155.jpg" width="500" alt="woman and girl come out of bushes" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The child laughed and darted into the little group</i></span></div>

<p>The child laughed and darted into the little
group, laying a large grape leaf on the lap of
each of the strangers. The little old woman
followed close behind her, shaking strawberries
from her basket onto each green leaf. Then
the little girl quickly laid another leaf on top
of the strawberries.
</p><p>
They were about to slip away into the
bushes again when May called, "Wait, wait,
good fairies! Thank you for your strawberries,
and please let us give you our sweet chocolate."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
</p><p>
The small basket was passed quickly around
again and the tiny tinsel-covered cakes were
all dropped into it. Then the two little
people, with smiling lips and shining eyes,
slipped away into the tall bushes.
</p><p>
"Oh! oh!" whispered Molly. "Were they
really, truly fairies?"
</p><p>
"Of course they were," answered May.
</p><p>
"Well," said her mother, "they brought us
strawberry sandwiches, anyway, and no one
but fairies could have known how much we
wanted them."
</p><p>
"That is so," said Molly. "Let's call it
our Fairy Tea Party. I never, never tasted
such sweet strawberries!"
</p><p>
The drive back to the Flower City was a
quiet one. Molly and May had so much to
think about. But when the next morning came
they were eager for the new day's experience.
</p><p>
"What shall we do to-day, father?" asked
Molly at the breakfast table.
</p><p>
"Well, how would you like to go shopping
on an old, old bridge which crosses the river
Arno?" asked her father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i157.jpg" width="500" alt="girls looking at building on bridge" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The Ponte Vecchio, where the Sunbonnet Babies went shopping</i></span></div>

<p>"Shopping on a bridge!" exclaimed both
little girls. "What can we buy on a bridge?"
</p><p>
"Oh, all the pretty jewelry you want,"
answered their father. "It is a two-story
bridge. It is called Ponte Vecchio. On each
side of the lower story is a row of small shops,
most of which sell jewelry&mdash;pretty neck chains
and pins and rings. The second story is part of
a long, covered passage connecting two famous
old palaces. The passage is more than a third
of a mile long. It was built for the wedding of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
a prince in one of the families. The palaces are
now filled with beautiful paintings and sculpture.
We must go to see them soon."
</p><p>
And so several days were happily filled with
shopping and driving and seeing beautiful pictures
and wonderful old churches.
</p><p>
They found a tall bell tower in Florence even
more graceful and lovely than the Leaning
Tower at Pisa. It is called a "Lily in Stone,"
it is so very beautiful. The tower has stood
there beside the great cathedral for nearly six
hundred years, and it is as fresh and beautiful
now as when it was first built.</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE CITY IN THE SEA</h2>

<p class="p2">"To-day brings the great surprise," said the
Sunbonnet Babies' father one morning. "You
remember I said we should visit a place here
in Italy which you would like even better
than Sorrento or Capri. We are going to that
place to-day."
</p><p>
"Oh, where is it?" exclaimed both little
girls. "How shall we get there? What are
we going to see?"
</p><p>
"You must not ask so many questions. It
would not be a surprise if I should tell you
all about it," said their father. "But we shall
take the train this morning, and before we go
to bed to-night we shall be there."
</p><p>
All day Molly and May were much excited
thinking about the wonderful surprise awaiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
them. Their train carried them slowly northward
through the lovely Italian country straight
toward the high mountains.
</p><p>
"Must we go over those mountains, father,
or can we go through them?" May asked
eagerly.
</p><p>
"We shall do both," answered her father.
"We shall go over a part of them and we
shall go through the rest. In a moment our
train will enter the first tunnel."
</p><p>
"Oh! Oh! We are in it now!" exclaimed
Molly. "How dark it is!"
</p><p>
Then, almost before she knew it, they were
out in the bright sunshine again, creeping
along a high bridge above a deep valley. In
and out of many tunnels they went, and
across many high bridges from which they had
wonderful glimpses of the valleys and rivers
below and of the mountains towering high
above them.
</p><p>
"Is this Switzerland, father?" Molly asked
at last.
</p><p>
"No, indeed," answered her father. "We
are crossing the Apennine Mountains, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
stretch down through Italy like the backbone
of a fish. But we shall soon be leaving the
mountains behind us and shall see the canals
and the rice fields on the other side of them.
Then you may think you are in Japan."
</p><p>
And so they traveled northward, seeing
many new and interesting sights, until just at
sunset they came to what their father called
the "Jumping-off Place."
</p><p>
"Close your eyes for a moment," he said.
"I will tell you when to open them."
</p><p>
So Molly and May closed their eyes very
tightly until their father said, "Now you may
look."
</p><p>
"Oh! Oh! Where are we? Our train is
running right on the water!" exclaimed May
as she opened her eyes.
</p><p>
"Why, yes! There is water on both sides of
us!" cried Molly. "There is water all around
us. It looks like the sea. O father! Is there
a bridge under us? Will our train sink?"
</p><p>
"No, our train will not sink," answered
her father, laughing. "There is a real railroad
track under us. The track is built on strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
wooden posts or piles which are sunk deep
down into the ground under the water."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i163.jpg" width="500" alt="girls on train looking out window at water and city on the water" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>"Our train is running right on the water!"</i></span></div>

<p>"How far out on the water will the train go?"
May asked, in a voice just a little frightened.
</p><p>
"About two miles," answered her father.
"We are going to the City in the Sea."
</p><p>
"Oh, I know now!" cried Molly. "We are
going to Venice! We are going to Venice,
May! That is the wonderful surprise. We
are almost there. I can see some of the
houses now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
</p><p>
A few moments later their train was pulling
into a busy covered station and everybody
was getting off, for no one goes beyond Venice
by train. A porter took their bags, and the
Sunbonnet Babies thought he would show them
where to find a carriage or a taxi to take
them to their hotel. But no, he led them to
a long line of small black boats which were
drawn up to the station platform.
</p><p>
"O father! Are these boats gondolas?" asked
Molly excitedly. "And is this one of the
water streets you have told us about?"
</p><p>
"Yes," said her father, "and this man is
going to take us to our hotel in his gondola.
So jump in!"
</p><p>
When they were all seated, an old man
standing on the platform gave their gondola a
push with his long pole and they were off.
</p><p>
The gondolier stood in the back of his
graceful boat and paddled it lightly forward
with one long oar.
</p><p>
Out into the sunset glow of the broad canal
they slipped quietly. The soft colors of the
setting sun, caught and reflected by the shining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
water, made a picture more beautiful than
they had seen in any art gallery in Italy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i165.jpg" width="500" alt="family riding in canal boat" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They glided around corners and through narrow canals</i></span></div>

<p>They glided around corners and through
narrow canals, until at last their gondolier
stopped his boat close by the marble steps of
a handsome stone building.
</p><p>
"This is to be our home while we stay in
Venice," said the Sunbonnet Babies' father.
</p><p>
"Oh! I wish we could stay here always,"
Molly said softly.
</p><p>
"And so do I," whispered May.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i166.jpg" width="500" alt="girls feeding the pigeions" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The pigeons were as tame as little chickens</i></span></div>

<p>As the days went by, Molly and May did
not change their minds. Venice was like a fairy
land to them, and the hundreds of beautiful
pigeons that live about the Piazza of St. Mark
were the cunningest of playmates.
</p><p>
Each morning the children hurried to the
piazza to help give the doves their breakfast
of corn and peas. They were as tame as little
chickens. They would coo and flutter about
the Sunbonnet Babies and eat from their hands
as if they had always been friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i167.jpg" width="500" alt="pigeon landing on bonnet" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Sometimes a brave little pigeon would stand on one of the sunbonnets</i></span></div>

<p>Sometimes an especially brave little pigeon
would stand on one of the pretty sunbonnets,
turning his head about very proudly to be sure
that everyone was seeing him. But the pigeon
was no prouder than the little girl under the
bonnet, who stood very still lest she frighten
the pretty thing away.
</p><p>
There are very few dogs or cats in Venice, so
the pigeons have nothing to fear. They are
the pets of the whole city, and they sleep in the
prettiest places near the tops of the buildings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i168.jpg" width="500" alt="girls looking at horses at cathedral" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The great bronze horses at the Cathedral of St. Mark</i></span></div>

<p>There are only four horses in the city, too,
and they are great bronze horses two thousand
years old. They have stood above the doorway
of the beautiful Cathedral of St. Mark,
on one side of the piazza, more than seven
hundred years. Napoleon carried them off to
Paris and placed them on top of a fine arch
there, where they stayed for eighteen years,
but at last they were returned to Venice.
</p><p>
During the World War these famous horses
were taken down again and hidden away in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
safe place where bombs and robbers might not
touch them.
</p><p>
Now once more they are standing above
the beautiful doorway, with the pretty pigeons
flying lovingly about them.
</p><p>
There were many other things on the big
piazza, aside from the doves and the horses,
which interested the Sunbonnet Babies. There
was a strange old Clock Tower which has been
standing there since the time Columbus discovered
America. Two big bronze men stand on
top of the tower and strike the hours on a great
bell with their heavy hammers. First one man
raises his hammer and strikes the bell and
then the other man strikes it, until the right
hour has been struck, from one to twenty-four
o'clock, which is midnight.
</p><p>
It seemed strange for Molly and May to go
to bed at nineteen o'clock instead of seven,
but that was what they did in Italy, for there
the clock faces have twenty-four hours on
them instead of twelve.
</p><p>
There is another tower on the piazza, too,
much taller than the Clock Tower. It is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Cathedral Bell Tower, and it stands nearly in
front of the beautiful cathedral.
</p><p>
A few years ago the tower which had stood
on this spot for a thousand years fell quite
suddenly, for the bricks with which its walls
were made were turning to dust. But the
Venetian people soon built a new tower just
like the old one on the same spot, and they
expect it to stand another thousand years.
</p><p>
Molly and May climbed to the top of this
tall tower and looked out over the wonderful
city surrounded by the beautiful blue water.
They saw the green trees of the public gardens,
and the orange and blue sails of fishing boats
coming slowly in, loaded with fish caught out
in the deeper sea. They tried to count the
many gondolas moving quietly through the
busy canals, and they watched the tiny pigeons
fluttering about on the piazza below.
</p><p>
Around three sides of the piazza are handsome
little shops, with a broad covered sidewalk in
front of them. Nearly everything that is nice
can be bought in these shops, from beautiful
laces to delicious ice cream.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i171.jpg" width="500" alt="girls having ice cream at table outdoors" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>The Sunbonnet Babies often had cherry ice cream</i></span></div>

<p>The Sunbonnet Babies often begged to sit
by one of the small tables on the covered sidewalk
and have some cherry ice cream while the
band played in the center of the piazza.
</p><p>
The Piazza of St. Mark is really a wonderful
place. It is the open-air reception room
for all the Venetian people, as well as for many
strangers who come to visit their city&mdash;yes,
and for hundreds of beautiful pigeons, too.
</p><p>
But Molly and May loved the whole of
Venice. They liked to wander along the busy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
narrow footpaths and see how the people
worked and played. They found they could
walk all over the city on these narrow streets,
for there are nearly four hundred little foot-bridges
which cross the many canals. Some
of the bridges have steps going up on one side
and down on the other.
</p><p>
The largest and finest bridge is called the
Rialto Bridge. It has two rows of small shops
on it, much like the famous bridge in Florence.
</p><p>
Molly and May liked to go shopping on
the Rialto. They always bought a bag of big
red cherries, for Italian cherries are almost
better than chocolate creams.

<h2 class="p2">THE GONDOLIER'S HOME</h2>

<p class="p2">Every day Antonio, their gondolier, came to
take the Sunbonnet Babies and their parents
for a ride in his graceful boat.
</p><p>
Antonio usually wore blue trousers and a white
shirt, open at the neck and fastened with a
large red tie. But some days he dressed all
in white, with a bright red sash around his waist.
Then he looked very handsome indeed.
</p><p>
One morning Antonio invited the Sunbonnet
Babies to visit his home and see his little girls.
Antonio had lived in America seven years and
could speak English quite well.
</p><p>
"My little girls want to see you very much,"
he said. "I have told them all about your
pretty blue eyes and your big sunbonnets. Will
you come with me to-day?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
</p><p>
So it happened that Molly and May were
soon gliding through narrow canals into a part
of Venice they had not seen before.
</p><p>
It was morning, and they passed a milk man
delivering his milk in a flat-bottomed boat.
</p><p>
"That is a new kind of milk cart," exclaimed
Molly. "In Naples they have live milk carts,
and in Holland they have dog carts, and here
in Venice they have boats."
</p><p>
"And see! There is a man with a boat load
of vegetables," said May. "He has just sold a
string of onions and a cauliflower to the woman
standing in the doorway. If she should step
out of her door she would step right into the
canal. O Antonio! Is that the only door into
her house?"
</p><p>
"Oh, no!" said Antonio. "Nearly every
house in Venice has a canal door on one side
and a footpath door on the other side."
</p><p>
"See the woman up there on her balcony,"
said Molly. "She is lowering a basket by a
long rope. What is she saying, Antonio?"
</p><p>
"She wants a cauliflower and a string of
onions, too, but she thinks the man is asking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
too much for them. She has put a lira into
her basket and she is telling the man that he
must not touch it unless he is willing to give
her a good cauliflower and a long string of
onions for it. The other woman had to pay a
lira and a half for them. We will watch and
see what happens."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i176.jpg" width="500" alt="girls watching delivery made" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>He put them into the basket and look out the lira</i></span></div>

<p>"The man talks as if he didn't like it," said
Molly. "But see! He is putting them into
her basket and is taking out the lira. Now he
has laid a red rosebud on top of the onions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
He is lifting his hat and smiling at her while
she pulls up the basket."
</p><p>
"I knew she would get them," said Antonio.
"She is a good business woman."
</p><p>
As they glided along under the arch of a
low bridge, May asked, "How can your water
streets always look so clean, Antonio? Don't
people ever throw things into them?"
</p><p>
"Oh, yes!" answered Antonio, "But our
canals are all washed out twice a day. The
tide brings two or three feet of water into
every canal in Venice, and when it goes out
it carries all the refuse away into the sea. It is
very easy to keep our city streets clean."
</p><p>
"But, Antonio, why did the people want to
build a city 'way out here in the water? Why
didn't they stay on the land?" asked Molly.
</p><p>
"Well, it was because, thirteen hundred
years ago, the Huns came down from the north
and drove many of the Italian people away
from their homes and spoiled their towns. The
only safe place for them seemed to be out here
on some small, low islands, so they came and
began to make new homes for themselves. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
soon liked it here and built better homes and
fine ships. They sailed their ships far away
and traded with many people. They built
their houses and beautiful palaces and churches
on great wooden posts which they brought from
other lands. After a while their city became the
richest and most beautiful city in all the world.
We are not so rich now, but Venice is just as
beautiful and we are very proud of her."
</p><p>
"Of course you are," said May. "It is like
living in a wonderful, great picture book. I
should like to live here always."
</p><p>
"Well, this is where my little children live,"
said Antonio, as he stopped his gondola in front
of a low door just above the water's edge.
</p><p>
"Anita mia! Maria! Come quickly! Here
are two little friends for you."
</p><p>
As he called, two little girls about as tall
as Molly and May came bounding to the door.
They had large brown eyes and brown, curly
hair, and their cheeks were as pink as roses.
</p><p>
Molly and May thought the little Italian
girls were lovely, but Anita and Maria never
had dreamed of such beautiful blue eyes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
such lovely golden hair as they found under
the two pretty sunbonnets.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i179.jpg" width="500" alt="Molly and May meeting the two little Italian girls" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>They led the Sunbonnet Babies into their house</i></span></div>

<p>They took the Sunbonnet Babies each by
the hand and led them into their house. It
was a large, stone house, and they lived on the
first floor, not much above the canal.
</p><p>
The little guests were taken through the
large hall, which was the parlor, too, out into a
small courtyard beyond. Though this yard had
a stone floor, it looked like a real little garden.
There were long boxes of vines and blooming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
plants on the walls, and two or three small trees
in large pots. Lying on a pillow in a shady
corner was a dear little baby boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i180.jpg" width="500" alt="looking at the baby" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Lying on a pillow was a dear little baby boy</i></span></div>

<p>Anita and Maria were so proud of their baby
brother they wanted to show him to Molly and
May the very first thing.
</p><p>
"His name is Giorgio," said Maria. "He
is only three months old. See, I can hold him
in my arms."
</p><p>
"Where are his little feet?" asked Molly.
"Why is he tied up so tightly?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
</p><p>
"Oh, we always do our babies up in long
linen bands," Anita said. "It helps to keep
their little legs straight. And see, Giorgio's
bands are fastened with red and green ribbons.
Red and green are the Italian national colors,
you know."
</p><p>
"Doesn't he like to play and to kick with
his feet? Our babies do in America," said May.
</p><p>
"Oh, no!" answered Anita. "He isn't big
enough yet to know that he has any feet. But
see, he can smile for you."
</p><p>
"Mother is going to give baby a bath in the
canal now," said Maria. "He thinks it is lots
of fun and so do we. Would you like to watch
him have his bath?"
</p><p>
"Oh, we should love to!" exclaimed Molly
and May.
</p><p>
So they watched Giorgio's mother unwind
the yards and yards of linen bands which held
his tiny legs so stiff and straight. When the
little clothes were all off, the mother fastened a
soft cord loosely around under the baby's arms.
Then from the stone steps in front of her door,
she lowered her baby very gently into the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of the canal. Up and down she dipped him,
up and down, while he laughed and splashed
like a real boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i182.jpg" width="500" alt="Gorgio's mother dipping the baby into and out of the water" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Up and down she dipped him</i></span></div>

<p>"Just see him kick!" cried May. "He does
know that he has feet, Anita, and he knows
how to use them, too. Isn't he having a good
time?"
</p><p>
"And isn't he cunning?" said May.
</p><p>
At last the splashing and rubbing were over,
and Giorgio's mother covered him with a warm
shawl and carried him into her kitchen. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
laid him on a high table, and wound the long
linen bands around the little legs once more.
</p><p>
"When Giorgio is a bit stronger," she said,
"I shall loosen his bands so that he can kick
and play. Then it will not be long before he
will be wearing little pants. Now he must go
back to his pillow in the courtyard while I get
our dinner. We want you little girls to have
dinner with us."
</p><p>
"Thank you!" said Molly and May. "We
should like to very much. This is a lovely
kitchen. Do you keep all of your dishes on the
walls?"
</p><p>
"Oh, no, indeed!" Maria answered, laughing.
"Mother keeps only her best brass and pewter
dishes on the walls. Some of them are very,
very old. When Anita and I are married, mother
will give them to us and we shall put them on
our kitchen walls. We think they are beautiful."
</p><p>
"Yes, they are lovely," said May, "but what
an odd stove you have. It looks like a part
of the wall."
</p><p>
"It is built right into the wall," said Anita.
"Our dinner is cooking in the two black kettles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
hanging over the fire. It will be ready very
soon now."
</p><p>
There was boiled fish in one of the kettles
and corn meal mush, or polenta, in the other
one. The poorer people of Venice have polenta
and boiled fish for dinner nearly every day.
Perhaps once a week they have meat and a
fresh vegetable, and sometimes macaroni with
grated cheese sprinkled over it.
</p><p>
Molly and May liked the polenta and boiled
fish very much. It was nicely cooked, and they
were hungry. When they had eaten all they
wanted, a basket of ripe red cherries was placed
on the table. Antonio had brought the cherries
home as a special treat for the Sunbonnet Babies
and his own little girls. And how they did
enjoy them!
</p><p>
After dinner Antonio took Molly and May
back to their father and mother in the hotel.
Anita and Maria went, too, for they liked to
ride in their father's fine gondola, and they
wanted to be with their little new friends as
long as possible.
</p><p>
"I wish we had something nice to give them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
so they will never forget us, May," whispered
Molly, as they stepped out of the gondola.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i185.jpg" width="500" alt="all four girls riding in gondola" /><br /><span class="caption"><i>Anita and Maria liked to ride in their father's gondola</i></span></div>

<p>"I know what we can do, Molly. Let's give
them our sunbonnets. Mother has two more in
her trunk, and we are going home soon, you
know."
</p><p>
In another moment the two pretty sunbonnets
were changed from the golden heads
to the brown. Molly tied her pink bonnet over
Anita's brown curls and May tied her blue
bonnet over Maria's brown curls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
</p><p>
"Now there will always be two Sunbonnet
Babies in Italy," they said, laughing. "Thank
you for our happy, happy day. Addio, little
Italian Sunbonnet Babies! Addio!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
</p><p class="p2">
<i>Dear Boys and Girls:</i>
</p><p>
<i>The Sunbonnet Babies think Italy is the nicest
country they have ever seen, excepting of course
their own dear America. I wonder if you will
agree with them when you read all about what they
did and what they saw in that sunny, happy land.</i>
</p><p>
<i>To be sure, in the little country of Holland they
saw great green pastures where thousands of fine
cows were feeding, and fields and fields of beautiful
tulips, and miles and miles of canals, and tall
windmills pumping water or grinding grain.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They visited quaint little villages where the
people dressed in odd, pretty costumes, and they
had happy times playing with the Dutch children.
But they did not see a mountain or even a high hill
in all Holland, and there were no lovely, woodsy
lakes like those they knew in America.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The Overall Boys have told them about the
wonderful mountains and the dark forests and
the beautiful lakes which they saw in Switzerland.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But the Sunbonnet Babies saw all these things in
Italy, too, and, what is more, they saw a beautiful,
beautiful city surrounded by lovely, blue water,
with miles of water streets flowing through it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Then they visited another city which, many,
many years before, had been buried by hot lava and
ashes thrown out from a volcano near by. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
day they walked across the crater of another volcano
and saw hot, boiling sand almost at their feet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They took long, beautiful drives through the
country and along the seashore. They explored a
great cave under the Humpbacked Island, and had
an exciting experience with two pirates.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But they enjoyed best of all their many little
tea parties from sunny Capri to the City in the Sea.
Nearly every afternoon they sat by a small table
under an orange tree, or beside the blue water, or
on a city sidewalk, and had nice things to eat and
drink.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The people were always kind to them and
the sky was nearly always sunny. It is a land
of sunshine and flowers and fruit, like our own
sunny Florida, though Italy is much more beautiful.
It is hardly twice the size of Florida, but
nearly one-third as many people live there as live
in the whole of our great United States. It is a
crowded, happy, lovely country, and Molly and
May will never forget their wonderful journey
through it.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Sincerely your friend</i>,</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Eulalie Osgood Grover</span></p>
